THE CASTLE OF OTRANTO<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family
in the north of England.&nbsp; It was printed at Naples, in the black
letter, in the year 1529.&nbsp; How much sooner it was written does
not appear.&nbsp; The principal incidents are such as were believed
in the darkest ages of Christianity; but the language and conduct have
nothing that savours of barbarism.&nbsp; The style is the purest Italian.<br>
<br>
If the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have happened,
it must have been between 1095, the era of the first Crusade, and 1243,
the date of the last, or not long afterwards.&nbsp; There is no other
circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in
which the scene is laid: the names of the actors are evidently fictitious,
and probably disguised on purpose: yet the Spanish names of the domestics
seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the establishment
of the Arragonian Kings in Naples had made Spanish appellations familiar
in that country.&nbsp; The beauty of the diction, and the zeal of the
author (moderated, however, by singular judgment) concur to make me
think that the date of the composition was little antecedent to that
of the impression.&nbsp; Letters were then in their most flourishing
state in Italy, and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition,
at that time so forcibly attacked by the reformers.&nbsp; It is not
unlikely that an artful priest might endeavour to turn their own arms
on the innovators, and might avail himself of his abilities as an author
to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions.&nbsp;
If this was his view, he has certainly acted with signal address.&nbsp;
Such a work as the following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond
half the books of controversy that have been written from the days of
Luther to the present hour.<br>
<br>
This solution of the author&rsquo;s motives is, however, offered as
a mere conjecture.&nbsp; Whatever his views were, or whatever effects
the execution of them might have, his work can only be laid before the
public at present as a matter of entertainment.&nbsp; Even as such,
some apology for it is necessary.&nbsp; Miracles, visions, necromancy,
dreams, and other preternatural events, are exploded now even from romances.&nbsp;
That was not the case when our author wrote; much less when the story
itself is supposed to have happened.&nbsp; Belief in every kind of prodigy
was so established in those dark ages, that an author would not be faithful
to the manners of the times, who should omit all mention of them.&nbsp;
He is not bound to believe them himself, but he must represent his actors
as believing them.<br>
<br>
If this air of the miraculous is excused, the reader will find nothing
else unworthy of his perusal.&nbsp; Allow the possibility of the facts,
and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation.&nbsp;
There is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions, or unnecessary
descriptions.&nbsp; Everything tends directly to the catastrophe.&nbsp;
Never is the reader&rsquo;s attention relaxed.&nbsp; The rules of the
drama are almost observed throughout the conduct of the piece.&nbsp;
The characters are well drawn, and still better maintained.&nbsp; Terror,
the author&rsquo;s principal engine, prevents the story from ever languishing;
and it is so often contrasted by pity, that the mind is kept up in a
constant vicissitude of interesting passions.<br>
<br>
Some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little
serious for the general cast of the story; but besides their opposition
to the principal personages, the art of the author is very observable
in his conduct of the subalterns.&nbsp; They discover many passages
essential to the story, which could not be well brought to light but
by their <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and simplicity.&nbsp; In particular,
the womanish terror and foibles of Bianca, in the last chapter, conduce
essentially towards advancing the catastrophe.<br>
<br>
It is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted
work.&nbsp; More impartial readers may not be so much struck with the
beauties of this piece as I was.&nbsp; Yet I am not blind to my author&rsquo;s
defects.&nbsp; I could wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful
moral than this: that &ldquo;the sins of fathers are visited on their
children to the third and fourth generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; I doubt whether,
in his time, any more than at present, ambition curbed its appetite
of dominion from the dread of so remote a punishment.&nbsp; And yet
this moral is weakened by that less direct insinuation, that even such
anathema may be diverted by devotion to St. Nicholas.&nbsp; Here the
interest of the Monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the
author.&nbsp; However, with all its faults, I have no doubt but the
English reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance.&nbsp;
The piety that reigns throughout, the lessons of virtue that are inculcated,
and the rigid purity of the sentiments, exempt this work from the censure
to which romances are but too liable.&nbsp; Should it meet with the
success I hope for, I may be encouraged to reprint the original Italian,
though it will tend to depreciate my own labour.&nbsp; Our language
falls far short of the charms of the Italian, both for variety and harmony.&nbsp;
The latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative.&nbsp; It is
difficult in English to relate without falling too low or rising too
high; a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak
pure language in common conversation.&nbsp; Every Italian or Frenchman
of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and
with choice.&nbsp; I cannot flatter myself with having done justice
to my author in this respect: his style is as elegant as his conduct
of the passions is masterly.&nbsp; It is a pity that he did not apply
his talents to what they were evidently proper for - the theatre.<br>
<br>
I will detain the reader no longer, but to make one short remark.&nbsp;
Though the machinery is invention, and the names of the actors imaginary,
I cannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on
truth.&nbsp; The scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle.&nbsp;
The author seems frequently, without design, to describe particular
parts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chamber,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;on the right
hand;&rdquo; &ldquo;the door on the left hand;&rdquo; &ldquo;the distance
from the chapel to Conrad&rsquo;s apartment:&rdquo; these and other
passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building
in his eye.&nbsp; Curious persons, who have leisure to employ in such
researches, may possibly discover in the Italian writers the foundation
on which our author has built.&nbsp; If a catastrophe, at all resembling
that which he describes, is believed to have given rise to this work,
it will contribute to interest the reader, and will make the &ldquo;Castle
of Otranto&rdquo; a still more moving story.<br>

SONNET TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY MARY COKE.<br>

<br>
The gentle maid, whose hapless tale<br>
These melancholy pages speak;<br>
Say, gracious lady, shall she fail<br>
To draw the tear adown thy cheek?<br>
<br>
No; never was thy pitying breast<br>
Insensible to human woes;<br>
Tender, tho&rsquo; firm, it melts distrest<br>
For weaknesses it never knows.<br>
<br>
Oh! guard the marvels I relate<br>
Of fell ambition scourg&rsquo;d by fate,<br>
From reason&rsquo;s peevish blame.<br>
Blest with thy smile, my dauntless sail<br>
I dare expand to Fancy&rsquo;s gale,<br>
For sure thy smiles are Fame.<br>

CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter,
a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda.&nbsp; Conrad,
the son, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no
promising disposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never
showed any symptoms of affection to Matilda.&nbsp; Manfred had contracted
a marriage for his son with the Marquis of Vicenza&rsquo;s daughter,
Isabella; and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the
hands of Manfred, that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad&rsquo;s
infirm state of health would permit.<br>
<br>
Manfred&rsquo;s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family
and neighbours.&nbsp; The former, indeed, apprehending the severity
of their Prince&rsquo;s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises
on this precipitation.&nbsp; Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did
sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son
so early, considering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but
she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility,
who had given him but one heir.&nbsp; His tenants and subjects were
less cautious in their discourses.&nbsp; They attributed this hasty
wedding to the Prince&rsquo;s dread of seeing accomplished an ancient
prophecy, which was said to have pronounced that the castle and lordship
of Otranto &ldquo;should pass from the present family, whenever the
real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and still less easy
to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question.&nbsp; Yet
these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere
the less to their opinion.<br>
<br>
Young Conrad&rsquo;s birthday was fixed for his espousals.&nbsp; The
company was assembled in the chapel of the Castle, and everything ready
for beginning the divine office, when Conrad himself was missing.&nbsp;
Manfred, impatient of the least delay, and who had not observed his
son retire, despatched one of his attendants to summon the young Prince.&nbsp;
The servant, who had not stayed long enough to have crossed the court
to Conrad&rsquo;s apartment, came running back breathless, in a frantic
manner, his eyes staring, and foaming at the month.&nbsp; He said nothing,
but pointed to the court.<br>
<br>
The company were struck with terror and amazement.&nbsp; The Princess
Hippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her
son, swooned away.&nbsp; Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at
the procrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic,
asked imperiously what was the matter?&nbsp; The fellow made no answer,
but continued pointing towards the courtyard; and at last, after repeated
questions put to him, cried out, &ldquo;Oh! the helmet! the helmet!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from whence
was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise.&nbsp; Manfred,
who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get information
of what occasioned this strange confusion.&nbsp; Matilda remained endeavouring
to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same purpose, and
to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for whom, in truth,
she had conceived little affection.<br>
<br>
The first thing that struck Manfred&rsquo;s eyes was a group of his
servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain
of sable plumes.&nbsp; He gazed without believing his sight.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What are ye doing?&rdquo; cried Manfred, wrathfully; &ldquo;where
is my son?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A volley of voices replied, &ldquo;Oh! my Lord! the Prince! the Prince!
the helmet! the helmet!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what,
he advanced hastily, - but what a sight for a father&rsquo;s eyes! -
he beheld his child dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous
helmet, an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human
being, and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.<br>
<br>
The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this misfortune
had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon before him, took
away the Prince&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp; Yet his silence lasted longer
than even grief could occasion.&nbsp; He fixed his eyes on what he wished
in vain to believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his loss,
than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned
it.&nbsp; He touched, he examined the fatal casque; nor could even the
bleeding mangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes of Manfred
from the portent before him.<br>
<br>
All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much
surprised at their Prince&rsquo;s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves
at the miracle of the helmet.&nbsp; They conveyed the disfigured corpse
into the hall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred.&nbsp;
As little was he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel.&nbsp;
On the contrary, without mentioning the unhappy princesses, his wife
and daughter, the first sounds that dropped from Manfred&rsquo;s lips
were, &ldquo;Take care of the Lady Isabella.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction,
were guided by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as
peculiarly addressed to her situation, and flew to her assistance.&nbsp;
They conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent
to all the strange circumstances she heard, except the death of her
son.<br>
<br>
Matilda, who doted on her mother, smothered her own grief and amazement,
and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent.&nbsp;
Isabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a daughter, and who
returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less
assiduous about the Princess; at the same time endeavouring to partake
and lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw Matilda strove to suppress,
for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship.&nbsp;
Yet her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts.&nbsp;
She felt no concern for the death of young Conrad, except commiseration;
and she was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised
her little felicity, either from her destined bridegroom, or from the
severe temper of Manfred, who, though he had distinguished her by great
indulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from his causeless rigour
to such amiable princesses as Hippolita and Matilda.<br>
<br>
While the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed, Manfred
remained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless
of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around
him.&nbsp; The few words he articulated, tended solely to inquiries,
whether any man knew from whence it could have come?&nbsp; Nobody could
give him the least information.&nbsp; However, as it seemed to be the
sole object of his curiosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators,
whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the catastrophe
itself was unprecedented.&nbsp; In the midst of their senseless guesses,
a young peasant, whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village,
observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure
in black marble of Alfonso the Good, one of their former princes, in
the church of St. Nicholas.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Villain!&nbsp; What sayest thou?&rdquo; cried Manfred, starting
from his trance in a tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the
collar; &ldquo;how darest thou utter such treason?&nbsp; Thy life shall
pay for it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince&rsquo;s
fury as all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new
circumstance.&nbsp; The young peasant himself was still more astonished,
not conceiving how he had offended the Prince.&nbsp; Yet recollecting
himself, with a mixture of grace and humility, he disengaged himself
from Manfred&rsquo;s grip, and then with an obeisance, which discovered
more jealousy of innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what
he was guilty?&nbsp; Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however decently
exerted, with which the young man had shaken off his hold, than appeased
by his submission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and, if he had
not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials,
would have poignarded the peasant in their arms.<br>
<br>
During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the
great church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed,
declaring that the helmet was missing from Alfonso&rsquo;s statue.&nbsp;
Manfred, at this news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he sought
a subject on which to vent the tempest within him, he rushed again on
the young peasant, crying -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Villain! Monster! Sorcerer! &rsquo;tis thou hast done this! &rsquo;tis
thou hast slain my son!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities,
on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning, caught the
words from the mouth of their lord, and re-echoed -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay; &rsquo;tis he, &rsquo;tis he: he has stolen the helmet
from good Alfonso&rsquo;s tomb, and dashed out the brains of our young
Prince with it,&rdquo; never reflecting how enormous the disproportion
was between the marble helmet that had been in the church, and that
of steel before their eyes; nor how impossible it was for a youth seemingly
not twenty, to wield a piece of armour of so prodigious a weight<br>
<br>
The folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself: yet whether
provoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the
two helmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence
of that in the church, or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent
a supposition, he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly
a necromancer, and that till the Church could take cognisance of the
affair, he would have the Magician, whom they had thus detected, kept
prisoner under the helmet itself, which he ordered his attendants to
raise, and place the young man under it; declaring he should be kept
there without food, with which his own infernal art might furnish him.<br>
<br>
It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous
sentence: in vain did Manfred&rsquo;s friends endeavour to divert him
from this savage and ill-grounded resolution.&nbsp; The generality were
charmed with their lord&rsquo;s decision, which, to their apprehensions,
carried great appearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished
by the very instrument with which he had offended: nor were they struck
with the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved,
for they firmly believed that, by his diabolic skill, he could easily
supply himself with nutriment.<br>
<br>
Manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and appointing
a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the
prisoner, he dismissed his friends and attendants, and retired to his
own chamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he suffered
none but his domestics to remain.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the
Princess Hippolita to herself, who amidst the transports of her own
sorrow frequently demanded news of her lord, would have dismissed her
attendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave
her, and visit and comfort her father.&nbsp; Matilda, who wanted no
affectionate duty to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity,
obeyed the orders of Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to Isabella;
and inquiring of the domestics for her father, was informed that he
was retired to his chamber, and had commanded that nobody should have
admittance to him.&nbsp; Concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for
the death of her brother, and fearing to renew his tears by the sight
of his sole remaining child, she hesitated whether she should break
in upon his affliction; yet solicitude for him, backed by the commands
of her mother, encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had
given; a fault she had never been guilty of before.<br>
<br>
The gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at
his door.&nbsp; She heard him traverse his chamber backwards, and forwards
with disordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions.&nbsp;
She was, however, just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly
opened the door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder
of his mind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who
it was?&nbsp; Matilda replied, trembling -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dearest father, it is I, your daughter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, stepping back hastily, cried, &ldquo;Begone!&nbsp; I do not
want a daughter;&rdquo; and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door
against the terrified Matilda.<br>
<br>
She was too well acquainted with her father&rsquo;s impetuosity to venture
a second intrusion.&nbsp; When she had a little recovered the shock
of so bitter a reception, she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional
stab that the knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned
her in the most anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how he bore
his loss.&nbsp; Matilda assured her he was well, and supported his misfortune
with manly fortitude.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But will he not let me see him?&rdquo; said Hippolita mournfully;
&ldquo;will he not permit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a
mother&rsquo;s sorrows in the bosom of her Lord?&nbsp; Or do you deceive
me, Matilda?&nbsp; I know how Manfred doted on his son: is not the stroke
too heavy for him? has he not sunk under it?&nbsp; You do not answer
me - alas! I dread the worst! - Raise me, my maidens; I will, I will
see my Lord.&nbsp; Bear me to him instantly: he is dearer to me even
than my children.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Matilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita&rsquo;s rising;
and both those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to
stop and calm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred,
arrived and told Isabella that his Lord demanded to speak with her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;With me!&rdquo; cried Isabella.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her Lord:
&ldquo;Manfred cannot support the sight of his own family.&nbsp; He
thinks you less disordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief.&nbsp;
Console him, dear Isabella, and tell him I will smother my own anguish
rather than add to his.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As it was now evening the servant who conducted Isabella bore a torch
before her.&nbsp; When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently
about the gallery, he started, and said hastily -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Take away that light, and begone.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against
the wall, and bade Isabella sit by him.&nbsp; She obeyed trembling.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I sent for you, Lady,&rdquo; said he - and then stopped under
great appearance of confusion.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,&rdquo; resumed
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dry your tears, young Lady - you have lost your bridegroom.&nbsp;
Yes, cruel fate! and I have lost the hopes of my race!&nbsp; But Conrad
was not worthy of your beauty.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How, my Lord!&rdquo; said Isabella; &ldquo;sure you do not suspect
me of not feeling the concern I ought: my duty and affection would have
always - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Think no more of him,&rdquo; interrupted Manfred; &ldquo;he was
a sickly, puny child, and Heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I
might not trust the honours of my house on so frail a foundation.&nbsp;
The line of Manfred calls for numerous supports.&nbsp; My foolish fondness
for that boy blinded the eyes of my prudence - but it is better as it
is.&nbsp; I hope, in a few years, to have reason to rejoice at the death
of Conrad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Words cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella.&nbsp; At first she
apprehended that grief had disordered Manfred&rsquo;s understanding.&nbsp;
Her next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed
to ensnare her: she feared that Manfred had perceived her indifference
for his son: and in consequence of that idea she replied -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: my heart would have
accompanied my hand.&nbsp; Conrad would have engrossed all my care;
and wherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory,
and regard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Curse on Hippolita!&rdquo; cried Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forget
her from this moment, as I do.&nbsp; In short, Lady, you have missed
a husband undeserving of your charms: they shall now be better disposed
of.&nbsp; Instead of a sickly boy, you shall have a husband in the prime
of his age, who will know how to value your beauties, and who may expect
a numerous offspring.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas, my Lord!&rdquo; said Isabella, &ldquo;my mind is too sadly
engrossed by the recent catastrophe in your family to think of another
marriage.&nbsp; If ever my father returns, and it shall be his pleasure,
I shall obey, as I did when I consented to give my hand to your son:
but until his return, permit me to remain under your hospitable roof,
and employ the melancholy hours in assuaging yours, Hippolita&rsquo;s,
and the fair Matilda&rsquo;s affliction.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I desired you once before,&rdquo; said Manfred angrily, &ldquo;not
to name that woman: from this hour she must be a stranger to you, as
she must be to me.&nbsp; In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you
my son, I offer you myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, &ldquo;what
do I hear?&nbsp; You! my Lord!&nbsp; You!&nbsp; My father-in-law! the
father of Conrad! the husband of the virtuous and tender Hippolita!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Manfred imperiously, &ldquo;Hippolita
is no longer my wife; I divorce her from this hour.&nbsp; Too long has
she cursed me by her unfruitfulness.&nbsp; My fate depends on having
sons, and this night I trust will give a new date to my hopes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At those words he seized the cold hand of Isabella, who was half dead
with fright and horror.&nbsp; She shrieked, and started from him, Manfred
rose to pursue her, when the moon, which was now up, and gleamed in
at the opposite casement, presented to his sight the plumes of the fatal
helmet, which rose to the height of the windows, waving backwards and
forwards in a tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and
rustling sound.&nbsp; Isabella, who gathered courage from her situation,
and who dreaded nothing so much as Manfred&rsquo;s pursuit of his declaration,
cried -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look, my Lord! see, Heaven itself declares against your impious
intentions!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heaven nor Hell shall impede my designs,&rdquo; said Manfred,
advancing again to seize the Princess.<br>
<br>
At that instant the portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the
bench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved its
breast.<br>
<br>
Isabella, whose back was turned to the picture, saw not the motion,
nor knew whence the sound came, but started, and said -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hark, my Lord!&nbsp; What sound was that?&rdquo; and at the same
time made towards the door.<br>
<br>
Manfred, distracted between the flight of Isabella, who had now reached
the stairs, and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture, which
began to move, had, however, advanced some steps after her, still looking
backwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit its panel, and descend
on the floor with a grave and melancholy air.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do I dream?&rdquo; cried Manfred, returning; &ldquo;or are the
devils themselves in league against me?&nbsp; Speak, internal spectre!&nbsp;
Or, if thou art my grandsire, why dost thou too conspire against thy
wretched descendant, who too dearly pays for - &rdquo;&nbsp; Ere he
could finish the sentence, the vision sighed again, and made a sign
to Manfred to follow him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; cried Manfred; &ldquo;I will follow thee to the
gulf of perdition.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end of the gallery,
and turned into a chamber on the right hand.&nbsp; Manfred accompanied
him at a little distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved.&nbsp;
As he would have entered the chamber, the door was clapped to with violence
by an invisible hand.&nbsp; The Prince, collecting courage from this
delay, would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found
that it resisted his utmost efforts.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Since Hell will not satisfy my curiosity,&rdquo; said Manfred,
&ldquo;I will use the human means in my power for preserving my race;
Isabella shall not escape me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had
quitted Manfred, continued her flight to the bottom of the principal
staircase.&nbsp; There she stopped, not knowing whither to direct her
steps, nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince.&nbsp; The
gates of the castle, she knew, were locked, and guards placed in the
court.&nbsp; Should she, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare Hippolita
for the cruel destiny that awaited her, she did not doubt but Manfred
would seek her there, and that his violence would incite him to double
the injury he meditated, without leaving room for them to avoid the
impetuosity of his passions.&nbsp; Delay might give him time to reflect
on the horrid measures he had conceived, or produce some circumstance
in her favour, if she could - for that night, at least - avoid his odious
purpose.&nbsp; Yet where conceal herself?&nbsp; How avoid the pursuit
he would infallibly make throughout the castle?<br>
<br>
As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she recollected a
subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the
church of St. Nicholas.&nbsp; Could she reach the altar before she was
overtaken, she knew even Manfred&rsquo;s violence would not dare to
profane the sacredness of the place; and she determined, if no other
means of deliverance offered, to shut herself up for ever among the
holy virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral.&nbsp; In
this resolution, she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase,
and hurried towards the secret passage.<br>
<br>
The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloisters;
and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the door that
opened into the cavern.&nbsp; An awful silence reigned throughout those
subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of wind that
shook the doors she had passed, and which, grating on the rusty hinges,
were re-echoed through that long labyrinth of darkness.&nbsp; Every
murmur struck her with new terror; yet more she dreaded to hear the
wrathful voice of Manfred urging his domestics to pursue her.<br>
<br>
She trod as softly as impatience would give her leave, yet frequently
stopped and listened to hear if she was followed.&nbsp; In one of those
moments she thought she heard a sigh.&nbsp; She shuddered, and recoiled
a few paces.&nbsp; In a moment she thought she heard the step of some
person.&nbsp; Her blood curdled; she concluded it was Manfred.&nbsp;
Every suggestion that horror could inspire rushed into her mind.&nbsp;
She condemned her rash flight, which had thus exposed her to his rage
in a place where her cries were not likely to draw anybody to her assistance.&nbsp;
Yet the sound seemed not to come from behind.&nbsp; If Manfred knew
where she was, he must have followed her.&nbsp; She was still in one
of the cloisters, and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed
from the way she had come.&nbsp; Cheered with this reflection, and hoping
to find a friend in whoever was not the Prince, she was going to advance,
when a door that stood ajar, at some distance to the left, was opened
gently: but ere her lamp, which she held up, could discover who opened
it, the person retreated precipitately on seeing the light.<br>
<br>
Isabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether
she should proceed.&nbsp; Her dread of Manfred soon outweighed every
other terror.&nbsp; The very circumstance of the person avoiding her
gave her a sort of courage.&nbsp; It could only be, she thought, some
domestic belonging to the castle.&nbsp; Her gentleness had never raised
her an enemy, and conscious innocence made her hope that, unless sent
by the Prince&rsquo;s order to seek her, his servants would rather assist
than prevent her flight.&nbsp; Fortifying herself with these reflections,
and believing by what she could observe that she was near the mouth
of the subterraneous cavern, she approached the door that had been opened;
but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door extinguished her
lamp, and left her in total darkness.<br>
<br>
Words cannot paint the horror of the Princess&rsquo;s situation.&nbsp;
Alone in so dismal a place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible
events of the day, hopeless of escaping, expecting every moment the
arrival of Manfred, and far from tranquil on knowing she was within
reach of somebody, she knew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed
thereabouts; all these thoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and
she was ready to sink under her apprehensions.&nbsp; She addressed herself
to every saint in heaven, and inwardly implored their assistance.&nbsp;
For a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair.<br>
<br>
At last, as softly as was possible, she felt for the door, and having
found it, entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard
the sigh and steps.&nbsp; It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive
an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault,
which seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth
or building, she could not distinguish which, that appeared to have
been crushed inwards.&nbsp; She advanced eagerly towards this chasm,
when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall.<br>
<br>
She shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad.&nbsp;
The figure, advancing, said, in a submissive voice -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Be not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Isabella, a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the
stranger, and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened
the door, recovered her spirits enough to reply -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir, whoever you are, take pity on a wretched Princess, standing
on the brink of destruction.&nbsp; Assist me to escape from this fatal
castle, or in a few moments I may be made miserable for ever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;what can I do to assist
you?&nbsp; I will die in your defence; but I am unacquainted with the
castle, and want - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Isabella, hastily interrupting him; &ldquo;help
me but to find a trap-door that must be hereabout, and it is the greatest
service you can do me, for I have not a minute to lose.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Saying a these words, she felt about on the pavement, and directed the
stranger to search likewise, for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in
one of the stones.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is the lock, which opens with a
spring, of which I know the secret.&nbsp; If we can find that, I may
escape - if not, alas! courteous stranger, I fear I shall have involved
you in my misfortunes: Manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of
my flight, and you will fall a victim to his resentment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I value not my life,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;and it
will be some comfort to lose it in trying to deliver you from his tyranny.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Generous youth,&rdquo; said Isabella, &ldquo;how shall I ever
requite - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
As she uttered those words, a ray of moonshine, streaming through a
cranny of the ruin above, shone directly on the lock they sought.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! transport!&rdquo; said Isabella; &ldquo;here is the trap-door!&rdquo;
and, taking out the key, she touched the spring, which, starting aside,
discovered an iron ring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift up the door,&rdquo; said
the Princess.<br>
<br>
The stranger obeyed, and beneath appeared some stone steps descending
into a vault totally dark.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We must go down here,&rdquo; said Isabella.&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow
me; dark and dismal as it is, we cannot miss our way; it leads directly
to the church of St. Nicholas.&nbsp; But, perhaps,&rdquo; added the
Princess modestly, &ldquo;you have no reason to leave the castle, nor
have I farther occasion for your service; in a few minutes I shall be
safe from Manfred&rsquo;s rage - only let me know to whom I am so much
obliged.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will never quit you,&rdquo; said the stranger eagerly, &ldquo;until
I have placed you in safety - nor think me, Princess, more generous
than I am; though you are my principal care - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
The stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed
approaching, and they soon distinguished these words -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Talk not to me of necromancers; I tell you she must be in the
castle; I will find her in spite of enchantment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; cried Isabella; &ldquo;it is the voice of
Manfred!&nbsp; Make haste, or we are ruined! and shut the trap-door
after you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Saying this, she descended the steps precipitately; and as the stranger
hastened to follow her, he let the door slip out of his hands: it fell,
and the spring closed over it.&nbsp; He tried in vain to open it, not
having observed Isabella&rsquo;s method of touching the spring; nor
had he many moments to make an essay.&nbsp; The noise of the falling
door had been heard by Manfred, who, directed by the sound, hastened
thither, attended by his servants with torches.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It must be Isabella,&rdquo; cried Manfred, before he entered
the vault.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is escaping by the subterraneous passage,
but she cannot have got far.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
What was the astonishment of the Prince when, instead of Isabella, the
light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he thought
confined under the fatal helmet!<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;how camest thou here?&nbsp;
I thought thee in durance above in the court.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am no traitor,&rdquo; replied the young man boldly, &ldquo;nor
am I answerable for your thoughts.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Presumptuous villain!&rdquo; cried Manfred; &ldquo;dost thou
provoke my wrath?&nbsp; Tell me, how hast thou escaped from above?&nbsp;
Thou hast corrupted thy guards, and their lives shall answer it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My poverty,&rdquo; said the peasant calmly, &ldquo;will disculpate
them: though the ministers of a tyrant&rsquo;s wrath, to thee they are
faithful, and but too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly
imposed upon them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance?&rdquo; said the Prince;
&ldquo;but tortures shall force the truth from thee.&nbsp; Tell me;
I will know thy accomplices.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There was my accomplice!&rdquo; said the youth, smiling, and
pointing to the roof.<br>
<br>
Manfred ordered the torches to be held up, and perceived that one of
the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the pavement
of the court, as his servants had let it fall over the peasant, and
had broken through into the vault, leaving a gap, through which the
peasant had pressed himself some minutes before he was found by Isabella.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Was that the way by which thou didst descend?&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said the youth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But what noise was that,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;which I
heard as I entered the cloister?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A door clapped,&rdquo; said the peasant; &ldquo;I heard it as
well as you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What door?&rdquo; said Manfred hastily.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am not acquainted with your castle,&rdquo; said the peasant;
&ldquo;this is the first time I ever entered it, and this vault the
only part of it within which I ever was.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But I tell thee,&rdquo; said Manfred (wishing to find out if
the youth had discovered the trap-door), &ldquo;it was this way I heard
the noise.&nbsp; My servants heard it too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; interrupted one of them officiously, &ldquo;to
be sure it was the trap-door, and he was going to make his escape.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Peace, blockhead!&rdquo; said the Prince angrily; &ldquo;if he
was going to escape, how should he come on this side?&nbsp; I will know
from his own mouth what noise it was I heard.&nbsp; Tell me truly; thy
life depends on thy veracity.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My veracity is dearer to me than my life,&rdquo; said the peasant;
&ldquo;nor would I purchase the one by forfeiting the other.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indeed, young philosopher!&rdquo; said Manfred contemptuously;
&ldquo;tell me, then, what was the noise I heard?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ask me what I can answer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and put me to
death instantly if I tell you a lie.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of
the youth, cried -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, then, thou man of truth, answer!&nbsp; Was it the fall
of the trap-door that I heard?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said the youth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;and how didst thou come
to know there was a trap-door here?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine,&rdquo; replied
he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But what told thee it was a lock?&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How didst thou discover the secret of opening it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Providence, that delivered me from the helmet, was able to direct
me to the spring of a lock,&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Providence should have gone a little farther, and have placed
thee out of the reach of my resentment,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
Providence had taught thee to open the lock, it abandoned thee for a
fool, who did not know how to make use of its favours.&nbsp; Why didst
thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape?&nbsp; Why didst
thou shut the trap-door before thou hadst descended the steps?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I might ask you, my Lord,&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;how
I, totally unacquainted with your castle, was to know that those steps
led to any outlet? but I scorn to evade your questions.&nbsp; Wherever
those steps lead to, perhaps I should have explored the way - I could
not be in a worse situation than I was.&nbsp; But the truth is, I let
the trap-door fall: your immediate arrival followed.&nbsp; I had given
the alarm - what imported it to me whether I was seized a minute sooner
or a minute later?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art a resolute villain for thy years,&rdquo; said Manfred;
&ldquo;yet on reflection I suspect thou dost but trifle with me.&nbsp;
Thou hast not yet told me how thou didst open the lock.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That I will show you, my Lord,&rdquo; said the peasant; and,
taking up a fragment of stone that had fallen from above, he laid himself
on the trap-door, and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered
it, meaning to gain time for the escape of the Princess.&nbsp; This
presence of mind, joined to the frankness of the youth, staggered Manfred.&nbsp;
He even felt a disposition towards pardoning one who had been guilty
of no crime.&nbsp; Manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton
in cruelty unprovoked.&nbsp; The circumstances of his fortune had given
an asperity to his temper, which was naturally humane; and his virtues
were always ready to operate, when his passions did not obscure his
reason.<br>
<br>
While the Prince was in this suspense, a confused noise of voices echoed
through the distant vaults.&nbsp; As the sound approached, he distinguished
the clamours of some of his domestics, whom he had dispersed through
the castle in search of Isabella, calling out -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where is my Lord? where is the Prince?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; said Manfred, as they came nearer; &ldquo;have
you found the Princess?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The first that arrived, replied, &ldquo;Oh, my Lord!&nbsp; I am glad
we have found you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Found me!&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;have you found the Princess?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We thought we had, my Lord,&rdquo; said the fellow, looking terrified,
&ldquo;but - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But, what?&rdquo; cried the Prince; &ldquo;has she escaped?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jaquez and I, my Lord - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I and Diego,&rdquo; interrupted the second, who came up
in still greater consternation.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Speak one of you at a time,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;I ask
you, where is the Princess?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We do not know,&rdquo; said they both together; &ldquo;but we
are frightened out of our wits.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So I think, blockheads,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;what is it
has scared you thus?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! my Lord,&rdquo; said Jaquez, &ldquo;Diego has seen such a
sight! your Highness would not believe our eyes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What new absurdity is this?&rdquo; cried Manfred; &ldquo;give
me a direct answer, or, by Heaven - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, my Lord, if it please your Highness to hear me,&rdquo; said
the poor fellow, &ldquo;Diego and I - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I and Jaquez - &rdquo; cried his comrade.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Did not I forbid you to speak both at a time?&rdquo; said the
Prince: &ldquo;you, Jaquez, answer; for the other fool seems more distracted
than thou art; what is the matter?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My gracious Lord,&rdquo; said Jaquez, &ldquo;if it please your
Highness to hear me; Diego and I, according to your Highness&rsquo;s
orders, went to search for the young Lady; but being comprehensive that
we might meet the ghost of my young Lord, your Highness&rsquo;s son,
God rest his soul, as he has not received Christian burial - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sot!&rdquo; cried Manfred in a rage; &ldquo;is it only a ghost,
then, that thou hast seen?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! worse! worse! my Lord,&rdquo; cried Diego: &ldquo;I had rather
have seen ten whole ghosts.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Grant me patience!&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;these blockheads
distract me.&nbsp; Out of my sight, Diego! and thou, Jaquez, tell me
in one word, art thou sober? art thou raving? thou wast wont to have
some sense: has the other sot frightened himself and thee too?&nbsp;
Speak; what is it he fancies he has seen?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Jaquez, trembling, &ldquo;I was
going to tell your Highness, that since the calamitous misfortune of
my young Lord, God rest his precious soul! not one of us your Highness&rsquo;s
faithful servants - indeed we are, my Lord, though poor men - I say,
not one of us has dared to set a foot about the castle, but two together:
so Diego and I, thinking that my young Lady might be in the great gallery,
went up there to look for her, and tell her your Highness wanted something
to impart to her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;O blundering fools!&rdquo; cried Manfred; &ldquo;and in the meantime,
she has made her escape, because you were afraid of goblins! - Why,
thou knave! she left me in the gallery; I came from thence myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For all that, she may be there still for aught I know,&rdquo;
said Jaquez; &ldquo;but the devil shall have me before I seek her there
again - poor Diego!&nbsp; I do not believe he will ever recover it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Recover what?&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;am I never to learn
what it is has terrified these rascals? - but I lose my time; follow
me, slave; I will see if she is in the gallery.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my dear, good Lord,&rdquo; cried Jaquez,
&ldquo;do not go to the gallery.&nbsp; Satan himself I believe is in
the chamber next to the gallery.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants as an idle
panic, was struck at this new circumstance.&nbsp; He recollected the
apparition of the portrait, and the sudden closing of the door at the
end of the gallery.&nbsp; His voice faltered, and he asked with disorder
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is in the great chamber?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Jaquez, &ldquo;when Diego and I came into
the gallery, he went first, for he said he had more courage than I.&nbsp;
So when we came into the gallery we found nobody.&nbsp; We looked under
every bench and stool; and still we found nobody.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Were all the pictures in their places?&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; answered Jaquez; &ldquo;but we did not think
of looking behind them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;proceed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When we came to the door of the great chamber,&rdquo; continued
Jaquez, &ldquo;we found it shut.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And could not you open it?&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! yes, my Lord; would to Heaven we had not!&rdquo; replied
he - &ldquo;nay, it was not I neither; it was Diego: he was grown foolhardy,
and would go on, though I advised him not - if ever I open a door that
is shut again - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Trifle not,&rdquo; said Manfred, shuddering, &ldquo;but tell
me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the door.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I! my Lord!&rdquo; said Jaquez; &ldquo;I was behind Diego; but
I heard the noise.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jaquez,&rdquo; said Manfred, in a solemn tone of voice; &ldquo;tell
me, I adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors, what was it thou sawest?
what was it thou heardest?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was Diego saw it, my Lord, it was not I,&rdquo; replied Jaquez;
&ldquo;I only heard the noise.&nbsp; Diego had no sooner opened the
door, than he cried out, and ran back.&nbsp; I ran back too, and said,
&lsquo;Is it the ghost?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The ghost! no, no,&rsquo;
said Diego, and his hair stood on end - &lsquo;it is a giant, I believe;
he is all clad in armour, for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and
they are as large as the helmet below in the court.&rsquo;&nbsp; As
he said these words, my Lord, we heard a violent motion and the rattling
of armour, as if the giant was rising, for Diego has told me since that
he believes the giant was lying down, for the foot and leg were stretched
at length on the floor.&nbsp; Before we could get to the end of the
gallery, we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us, but
we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was following us - yet,
now I think on it, we must have heard him if he had pursued us - but
for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, good my Lord, send for the chaplain, and have
the castle exorcised, for, for certain, it is enchanted.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, pray do, my Lord,&rdquo; cried all the servants at once,
&ldquo;or we must leave your Highness&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Peace, dotards!&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;and follow me; I
will know what all this means.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We! my Lord!&rdquo; cried they with one voice; &ldquo;we would
not go up to the gallery for your Highness&rsquo;s revenue.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The young peasant, who had stood silent, now spoke.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Will your Highness,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;permit me to try this
adventure?&nbsp; My life is of consequence to nobody; I fear no bad
angel, and have offended no good one.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your behaviour is above your seeming,&rdquo; said Manfred, viewing
him with surprise and admiration - &ldquo;hereafter I will reward your
bravery - but now,&rdquo; continued he with a sigh, &ldquo;I am so circumstanced,
that I dare trust no eyes but my own.&nbsp; However, I give you leave
to accompany me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, when he first followed Isabella from the gallery, had gone
directly to the apartment of his wife, concluding the Princess had retired
thither.&nbsp; Hippolita, who knew his step, rose with anxious fondness
to meet her Lord, whom she had not seen since the death of their son.&nbsp;
She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his bosom,
but he pushed her rudely off, and said -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where is Isabella?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Isabella! my Lord!&rdquo; said the astonished Hippolita.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Isabella,&rdquo; cried Manfred imperiously; &ldquo;I want
Isabella.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; replied Matilda, who perceived how much his behaviour
had shocked her mother, &ldquo;she has not been with us since your Highness
summoned her to your apartment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tell me where she is,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;I do not
want to know where she has been.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My good Lord,&rdquo; says Hippolita, &ldquo;your daughter tells
you the truth: Isabella left us by your command, and has not returned
since; - but, my good Lord, compose yourself: retire to your rest: this
dismal day has disordered you.&nbsp; Isabella shall wait your orders
in the morning.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What, then, you know where she is!&rdquo; cried Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me directly, for I will not lose an instant - and you, woman,&rdquo;
speaking to his wife, &ldquo;order your chaplain to attend me forthwith.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Isabella,&rdquo; said Hippolita calmly, &ldquo;is retired, I
suppose, to her chamber: she is not accustomed to watch at this late
hour.&nbsp; Gracious my Lord,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;let me know
what has disturbed you.&nbsp; Has Isabella offended you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Trouble me not with questions,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;but
tell me where she is.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Matilda shall call her,&rdquo; said the Princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit
down, my Lord, and resume your wonted fortitude.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What, art thou jealous of Isabella?&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that
you wish to be present at our interview!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good heavens! my Lord,&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;what is
it your Highness means?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed,&rdquo; said the cruel
Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;Send your chaplain to me, and wait my pleasure
here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At these words he flung out of the room in search of Isabella, leaving
the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment,
and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating.<br>
<br>
Manfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the peasant and
a few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him.&nbsp; He
ascended the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery,
at the door of which he met Hippolita and her chaplain.&nbsp; When Diego
had been dismissed by Manfred, he had gone directly to the Princess&rsquo;s
apartment with the alarm of what he had seen.&nbsp; That excellent Lady,
who no more than Manfred doubted of the reality of the vision, yet affected
to treat it as a delirium of the servant.&nbsp; Willing, however, to
save her Lord from any additional shock, and prepared by a series of
griefs not to tremble at any accession to it, she determined to make
herself the first sacrifice, if fate had marked the present hour for
their destruction.&nbsp; Dismissing the reluctant Matilda to her rest,
who in vain sued for leave to accompany her mother, and attended only
by her chaplain, Hippolita had visited the gallery and great chamber;
and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours,
she met her Lord, and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg
and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an impression made by fear, and
the dark and dismal hour of the night, on the minds of his servants.&nbsp;
She and the chaplain had examined the chamber, and found everything
in the usual order.<br>
<br>
Manfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no
work of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which
so many strange events had thrown him.&nbsp; Ashamed, too, of his inhuman
treatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of
tenderness and duty, he felt returning love forcing itself into his
eyes; but not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom
he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed the
yearnings of his heart, and did not dare to lean even towards pity.&nbsp;
The next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy.<br>
<br>
Presuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered himself
that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would
obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade Isabella to
give him her hand - but ere he could indulge his horrid hope, he reflected
that Isabella was not to be found.&nbsp; Coming to himself, he gave
orders that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded, and
charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass
out.&nbsp; The young peasant, to whom he spoke favourably, he ordered
to remain in a small chamber on the stairs, in which there was a pallet-bed,
and the key of which he took away himself, telling the youth he would
talk with him in the morning.&nbsp; Then dismissing his attendants,
and bestowing a sullen kind of half-nod on Hippolita, he retired to
his own chamber.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matilda, who by Hippolita&rsquo;s order had retired to her apartment,
was ill-disposed to take any rest.&nbsp; The shocking fate of her brother
had deeply affected her.&nbsp; She was surprised at not seeing Isabella;
but the strange words which had fallen from her father, and his obscure
menace to the Princess his wife, accompanied by the most furious behaviour,
had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm.&nbsp; She waited anxiously
for the return of Bianca, a young damsel that attended her, whom she
had sent to learn what was become of Isabella.&nbsp; Bianca soon appeared,
and informed her mistress of what she had gathered from the servants,
that Isabella was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; She related the adventure
of the young peasant who had been discovered in the vault, though with
many simple additions from the incoherent accounts of the domestics;
and she dwelt principally on the gigantic leg and foot which had been
seen in the gallery-chamber.&nbsp; This last circumstance had terrified
Bianca so much, that she was rejoiced when Matilda told her that she
would not go to rest, but would watch till the Princess should rise.<br>
<br>
The young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of Isabella,
and on the threats of Manfred to her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what business
could he have so urgent with the chaplain?&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;Does
he intend to have my brother&rsquo;s body interred privately in the
chapel?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, Madam!&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;now I guess.&nbsp; As you
are become his heiress, he is impatient to have you married: he has
always been raving for more sons; I warrant he is now impatient for
grandsons.&nbsp; As sure as I live, Madam, I shall see you a bride at
last. - Good madam, you won&rsquo;t cast off your faithful Bianca: you
won&rsquo;t put Donna Rosara over me now you are a great Princess.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My poor Bianca,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;how fast your thoughts
amble!&nbsp; I a great princess!&nbsp; What hast thou seen in Manfred&rsquo;s
behaviour since my brother&rsquo;s death that bespeaks any increase
of tenderness to me?&nbsp; No, Bianca; his heart was ever a stranger
to me - but he is my father, and I must not complain.&nbsp; Nay, if
Heaven shuts my father&rsquo;s heart against me, it overpays my little
merit in the tenderness of my mother - O that dear mother! yes, Bianca,
&rsquo;tis there I feel the rugged temper of Manfred.&nbsp; I can support
his harshness to me with patience; but it wounds my soul when I am witness
to his causeless severity towards her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! Madam,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;all men use their wives
so, when they are weary of them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And yet you congratulated me but now,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;when
you fancied my father intended to dispose of me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I would have you a great Lady,&rdquo; replied Bianca, &ldquo;come
what will.&nbsp; I do not wish to see you moped in a convent, as you
would be if you had your will, and if my Lady, your mother, who knows
that a bad husband is better than no husband at all, did not hinder
you. - Bless me! what noise is that!&nbsp; St. Nicholas forgive me!&nbsp;
I was but in jest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is the wind,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;whistling through
the battlements in the tower above: you have heard it a thousand times.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;there was no harm neither in
what I said: it is no sin to talk of matrimony - and so, Madam, as I
was saying, if my Lord Manfred should offer you a handsome young Prince
for a bridegroom, you would drop him a curtsey, and tell him you would
rather take the veil?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&nbsp; I am in no such danger,&rdquo; said Matilda:
&ldquo;you know how many proposals for me he has rejected - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And you thank him, like a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam?&nbsp;
But come, Madam; suppose, to-morrow morning, he was to send for you
to the great council chamber, and there you should find at his elbow
a lovely young Prince, with large black eyes, a smooth white forehead,
and manly curling locks like jet; in short, Madam, a young hero resembling
the picture of the good Alfonso in the gallery, which you sit and gaze
at for hours together - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do not speak lightly of that picture,&rdquo; interrupted Matilda
sighing; &ldquo;I know the adoration with which I look at that picture
is uncommon - but I am not in love with a coloured panel.&nbsp; The
character of that virtuous Prince, the veneration with which my mother
has inspired me for his memory, the orisons which, I know not why, she
has enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade
me that somehow or other my destiny is linked with something relating
to him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lord, Madam! how should that be?&rdquo; said Bianca; &ldquo;I
have always heard that your family was in no way related to his: and
I am sure I cannot conceive why my Lady, the Princess, sends you in
a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb: he is no saint
by the almanack.&nbsp; If you must pray, why does she not bid you address
yourself to our great St. Nicholas?&nbsp; I am sure he is the saint
I pray to for a husband.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Perhaps my mind would be less affected,&rdquo; said Matilda,
&ldquo;if my mother would explain her reasons to me: but it is the mystery
she observes, that inspires me with this - I know not what to call it.&nbsp;
As she never acts from caprice, I am sure there is some fatal secret
at bottom - nay, I know there is: in her agony of grief for my brother&rsquo;s
death she dropped some words that intimated as much.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! dear Madam,&rdquo; cried Bianca, &ldquo;what were they?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;if a parent lets fall a word,
and wishes it recalled, it is not for a child to utter it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What! was she sorry for what she had said?&rdquo; asked Bianca;
&ldquo;I am sure, Madam, you may trust me - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;With my own little secrets when I have any, I may,&rdquo; said
Matilda; &ldquo;but never with my mother&rsquo;s: a child ought to have
no ears or eyes but as a parent directs.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well! to be sure, Madam, you were born to be a saint,&rdquo;
said Bianca, &ldquo;and there is no resisting one&rsquo;s vocation:
you will end in a convent at last.&nbsp; But there is my Lady Isabella
would not be so reserved to me: she will let me talk to her of young
men: and when a handsome cavalier has come to the castle, she has owned
to me that she wished your brother Conrad resembled him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bianca,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;I do not allow you to
mention my friend disrespectfully.&nbsp; Isabella is of a cheerful disposition,
but her soul is pure as virtue itself.&nbsp; She knows your idle babbling
humour, and perhaps has now and then encouraged it, to divert melancholy,
and enliven the solitude in which my father keeps us - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Blessed Mary!&rdquo; said Bianca, starting, &ldquo;there it is
again!&nbsp; Dear Madam, do you hear nothing? this castle is certainly
haunted!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;and listen!&nbsp; I did think
I heard a voice - but it must be fancy: your terrors, I suppose, have
infected me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indeed! indeed!&nbsp; Madam,&rdquo; said Bianca, half-weeping
with agony, &ldquo;I am sure I heard a voice.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Does anybody lie in the chamber beneath?&rdquo; said the Princess.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nobody has dared to lie there,&rdquo; answered Bianca, &ldquo;since
the great astrologer, that was your brother&rsquo;s tutor, drowned himself.&nbsp;
For certain, Madam, his ghost and the young Prince&rsquo;s are now met
in the chamber below - for Heaven&rsquo;s sake let us fly to your mother&rsquo;s
apartment!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I charge you not to stir,&rdquo; said Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
they are spirits in pain, we may ease their sufferings by questioning
them.&nbsp; They can mean no hurt to us, for we have not injured them
- and if they should, shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another?&nbsp;
Reach me my beads; we will say a prayer, and then speak to them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world!&rdquo;
cried Bianca.&nbsp; As she said those words they heard the casement
of the little chamber below Matilda&rsquo;s open.&nbsp; They listened
attentively, and in a few minutes thought they heard a person sing,
but could not distinguish the words.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This can be no evil spirit,&rdquo; said the Princess, in a low
voice; &ldquo;it is undoubtedly one of the family - open the window,
and we shall know the voice.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I dare not, indeed, Madam,&rdquo; said Bianca.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art a very fool,&rdquo; said Matilda, opening the window
gently herself.&nbsp; The noise the Princess made was, however, heard
by the person beneath, who stopped; and they concluded had heard the
casement open.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is anybody below?&rdquo; said the Princess; &ldquo;if there is,
speak.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said an unknown voice.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; said Matilda.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A stranger,&rdquo; replied the voice.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What stranger?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and how didst thou come
there at this unusual hour, when all the gates of the castle are locked?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am not here willingly,&rdquo; answered the voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
pardon me, Lady, if I have disturbed your rest; I knew not that I was
overheard.&nbsp; Sleep had forsaken me; I left a restless couch, and
came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of
morning, impatient to be dismissed from this castle.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thy words and accents,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;are of melancholy
cast; if thou art unhappy, I pity thee.&nbsp; If poverty afflicts thee,
let me know it; I will mention thee to the Princess, whose beneficent
soul ever melts for the distressed, and she will relieve thee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am indeed unhappy,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;and I know
not what wealth is.&nbsp; But I do not complain of the lot which Heaven
has cast for me; I am young and healthy, and am not ashamed of owing
my support to myself - yet think me not proud, or that I disdain your
generous offers.&nbsp; I will remember you in my orisons, and will pray
for blessings on your gracious self and your noble mistress - if I sigh,
Lady, it is for others, not for myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Now I have it, Madam,&rdquo; said Bianca, whispering the Princess;
&ldquo;this is certainly the young peasant; and, by my conscience, he
is in love - Well! this is a charming adventure! - do, Madam, let us
sift him.&nbsp; He does not know you, but takes you for one of my Lady
Hippolita&rsquo;s women.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Art thou not ashamed, Bianca!&rdquo; said the Princess.&nbsp;
 &ldquo;What right have we to pry into the secrets of this young man&rsquo;s
heart?&nbsp; He seems virtuous and frank, and tells us he is unhappy.&nbsp;
Are those circumstances that authorise us to make a property of him?&nbsp;
How are we entitled to his confidence?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lord, Madam! how little you know of love!&rdquo; replied Bianca;
&ldquo;why, lovers have no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And would you have <i>me</i> become a peasant&rsquo;s confidante?&rdquo;
said the Princess.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, then, let me talk to him,&rdquo; said Bianca; &ldquo;though
I have the honour of being your Highness&rsquo;s maid of honour, I was
not always so great.&nbsp; Besides, if love levels ranks, it raises
them too; I have a respect for any young man in love.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Peace, simpleton!&rdquo; said the Princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
he said he was unhappy, it does not follow that he must be in love.&nbsp;
Think of all that has happened to-day, and tell me if there are no misfortunes
but what love causes. - Stranger,&rdquo; resumed the Princess, &ldquo;if
thy misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault, and are within
the compass of the Princess Hippolita&rsquo;s power to redress, I will
take upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress.&nbsp; When
thou art dismissed from this castle, repair to holy father Jerome, at
the convent adjoining to the church of St. Nicholas, and make thy story
known to him, as far as thou thinkest meet.&nbsp; He will not fail to
inform the Princess, who is the mother of all that want her assistance.&nbsp;
Farewell; it is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man
at this unwonted hour.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;May the saints guard thee, gracious Lady!&rdquo; replied the
peasant; &ldquo;but oh! if a poor and worthless stranger might presume
to beg a minute&rsquo;s audience farther; am I so happy? the casement
is not shut; might I venture to ask - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Speak quickly,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;the morning dawns
apace: should the labourers come into the fields and perceive us - What
wouldst thou ask?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I know not how, I know not if I dare,&rdquo; said the Young stranger,
faltering; &ldquo;yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me
emboldens - Lady! dare I trust you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;what dost thou mean?&nbsp;
With what wouldst thou trust me?&nbsp; Speak boldly, if thy secret is
fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I would ask,&rdquo; said the peasant, recollecting himself, &ldquo;whether
what I have heard from the domestics is true, that the Princess is missing
from the castle?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What imports it to thee to know?&rdquo; replied Matilda.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thy first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity.&nbsp;
Dost thou come hither to pry into the secrets of Manfred?&nbsp; Adieu.&nbsp;
I have been mistaken in thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Saying these words she shut
the casement hastily, without giving the young man time to reply.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I had acted more wisely,&rdquo; said the Princess to Bianca,
with some sharpness, &ldquo;if I had let thee converse with this peasant;
his inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is not fit for me to argue with your Highness,&rdquo; replied
Bianca; &ldquo;but perhaps the questions I should have put to him would
have been more to the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask
him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! no doubt,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;you are a very discreet
personage!&nbsp; May I know what <i>you</i> would have asked him?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A bystander often sees more of the game than those that play,&rdquo;
answered Bianca.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does your Highness think, Madam, that
this question about my Lady Isabella was the result of mere curiosity?&nbsp;
No, no, Madam, there is more in it than you great folks are aware of.&nbsp;
Lopez told me that all the servants believe this young fellow contrived
my Lady Isabella&rsquo;s escape; now, pray, Madam, observe you and I
both know that my Lady Isabella never much fancied the Prince your brother.&nbsp;
Well! he is killed just in a critical minute - I accuse nobody.&nbsp;
A helmet falls from the moon - so, my Lord, your father says; but Lopez
and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician, and stole
it from Alfonso&rsquo;s tomb - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Have done with this rhapsody of impertinence,&rdquo; said Matilda.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay, Madam, as you please,&rdquo; cried Bianca; &ldquo;yet it
is very particular though, that my Lady Isabella should be missing the
very same day, and that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth
of the trap-door.&nbsp; I accuse nobody; but if my young Lord came honestly
by his death - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dare not on thy duty,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;to breathe
a suspicion on the purity of my dear Isabella&rsquo;s fame.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Purity, or not purity,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;gone she is
- a stranger is found that nobody knows; you question him yourself;
he tells you he is in love, or unhappy, it is the same thing - nay,
he owned he was unhappy about others; and is anybody unhappy about another,
unless they are in love with them? and at the very next word, he asks
innocently, pour soul! if my Lady Isabella is missing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;thy observations are
not totally without foundation - Isabella&rsquo;s flight amazes me.&nbsp;
The curiosity of the stranger is very particular; yet Isabella never
concealed a thought from me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So she told you,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;to fish out your
secrets; but who knows, Madam, but this stranger may be some Prince
in disguise?&nbsp; Do, Madam, let me open the window, and ask him a
few questions.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Matilda, &ldquo;I will ask him myself, if
he knows aught of Isabella; he is not worthy I should converse farther
with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was going to open the casement, when they
heard the bell ring at the postern-gate of the castle, which is on the
right hand of the tower, where Matilda lay.&nbsp; This prevented the
Princess from renewing the conversation with the stranger.<br>
<br>
After continuing silent for some time, &ldquo;I am persuaded,&rdquo;
said she to Bianca, &ldquo;that whatever be the cause of Isabella&rsquo;s
flight it had no unworthy motive.&nbsp; If this stranger was accessory
to it, she must be satisfied with his fidelity and worth.&nbsp; I observed,
did not you, Bianca? that his words were tinctured with an uncommon
infusion of piety.&nbsp; It was no ruffian&rsquo;s speech; his phrases
were becoming a man of gentle birth.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I told you, Madam,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;that I was sure
he was some Prince in disguise.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;if he was privy to her escape,
how will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight? why
expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my father&rsquo;s resentment?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As for that, Madam,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;if he could get
from under the helmet, he will find ways of eluding your father&rsquo;s
anger.&nbsp; I do not doubt but he has some talisman or other about
him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You resolve everything into magic,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;but
a man who has any intercourse with infernal spirits, does not dare to
make use of those tremendous and holy words which he uttered.&nbsp;
Didst thou not observe with what fervour he vowed to remember <i>me</i>
to heaven in his prayers?&nbsp; Yes; Isabella was undoubtedly convinced
of his piety.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult
to elope!&rdquo; said Bianca.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Madam, my Lady Isabella
is of another guess mould than you take her for.&nbsp; She used indeed
to sigh and lift up her eyes in your company, because she knows you
are a saint; but when your back was turned - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You wrong her,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;Isabella is no hypocrite;
she has a due sense of devotion, but never affected a call she has not.&nbsp;
On the contrary, she always combated my inclination for the cloister;
and though I own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds
me; though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us; I cannot
forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking
the veil.&nbsp; She wished to see me married, though my dower would
have been a loss to her and my brother&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; For her
sake I will believe well of this young peasant.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then you do think there is some liking between them,&rdquo; said
Bianca.&nbsp; While she was speaking, a servant came hastily into the
chamber and told the Princess that the Lady Isabella was found.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said Matilda.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She has taken sanctuary in St. Nicholas&rsquo;s church,&rdquo;
replied the servant; &ldquo;Father Jerome has brought the news himself;
he is below with his Highness.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where is my mother?&rdquo; said Matilda.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She is in her own chamber, Madam, and has asked for you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred had risen at the first dawn of light, and gone to Hippolita&rsquo;s
apartment, to inquire if she knew aught of Isabella.&nbsp; While he
was questioning her, word was brought that Jerome demanded to speak
with him.&nbsp; Manfred, little suspecting the cause of the Friar&rsquo;s
arrival, and knowing he was employed by Hippolita in her charities,
ordered him to be admitted, intending to leave them together, while
he pursued his search after Isabella.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is your business with me or the Princess?&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;With both,&rdquo; replied the holy man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lady
Isabella - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What of her?&rdquo; interrupted Manfred, eagerly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is at St. Nicholas&rsquo;s altar,&rdquo; replied Jerome.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That is no business of Hippolita,&rdquo; said Manfred with confusion;
&ldquo;let us retire to my chamber, Father, and inform me how she came
thither.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, my Lord,&rdquo; replied the good man, with an air of firmness
and authority, that daunted even the resolute Manfred, who could not
help revering the saint-like virtues of Jerome; &ldquo;my commission
is to both, and with your Highness&rsquo;s good-liking, in the presence
of both I shall deliver it; but first, my Lord, I must interrogate the
Princess, whether she is acquainted with the cause of the Lady Isabella&rsquo;s
retirement from your castle.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, on my soul,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;does Isabella charge
me with being privy to it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; interrupted Manfred, &ldquo;I pay due reverence
to your holy profession; but I am sovereign here, and will allow no
meddling priest to interfere in the affairs of my domestic.&nbsp; If
you have aught to say attend me to my chamber; I do not use to let my
wife be acquainted with the secret affairs of my state; they are not
within a woman&rsquo;s province.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said the holy man, &ldquo;I am no intruder into
the secrets of families.&nbsp; My office is to promote peace, to heal
divisions, to preach repentance, and teach mankind to curb their headstrong
passions.&nbsp; I forgive your Highness&rsquo;s uncharitable apostrophe;
I know my duty, and am the minister of a mightier prince than Manfred.&nbsp;
Hearken to him who speaks through my organs.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred trembled with rage and shame.&nbsp; Hippolita&rsquo;s countenance
declared her astonishment and impatience to know where this would end.&nbsp;
Her silence more strongly spoke her observance of Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The Lady Isabella,&rdquo; resumed Jerome, &ldquo;commends herself
to both your Highnesses; she thanks both for the kindness with which
she has been treated in your castle: she deplores the loss of your son,
and her own misfortune in not becoming the daughter of such wise and
noble Princes, whom she shall always respect as Parents; she prays for
uninterrupted union and felicity between you&rdquo; [Manfred&rsquo;s
colour changed]: &ldquo;but as it is no longer possible for her to be
allied to you, she entreats your consent to remain in sanctuary, till
she can learn news of her father, or, by the certainty of his death,
be at liberty, with the approbation of her guardians, to dispose of
herself in suitable marriage.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I shall give no such consent,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;but
insist on her return to the castle without delay: I am answerable for
her person to her guardians, and will not brook her being in any hands
but my own.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your Highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper,&rdquo;
replied the Friar.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I want no monitor,&rdquo; said Manfred, colouring; &ldquo;Isabella&rsquo;s
conduct leaves room for strange suspicions - and that young villain,
who was at least the accomplice of her flight, if not the cause of it
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The cause!&rdquo; interrupted Jerome; &ldquo;was a <i>young</i>
man the cause?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is not to be borne!&rdquo; cried Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am
I to be bearded in my own palace by an insolent Monk?&nbsp; Thou art
privy, I guess, to their amours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I would pray to heaven to clear up your uncharitable surmises,&rdquo;
said Jerome, &ldquo;if your Highness were not satisfied in your conscience
how unjustly you accuse me.&nbsp; I do pray to heaven to pardon that
uncharitableness: and I implore your Highness to leave the Princess
at peace in that holy place, where she is not liable to be disturbed
by such vain and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Cant not to me,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;but return and bring
the Princess to her duty.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is my duty to prevent her return hither,&rdquo; said Jerome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is where orphans and virgins are safest from the snares and
wiles of this world; and nothing but a parent&rsquo;s authority shall
take her thence.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am her parent,&rdquo; cried Manfred, &ldquo;and demand her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She wished to have you for her parent,&rdquo; said the Friar;
&ldquo;but Heaven that forbad that connection has for ever dissolved
all ties betwixt you: and I announce to your Highness - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stop! audacious man,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;and dread my
displeasure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Holy farther,&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;it is your office
to be no respecter of persons: you must speak as your duty prescribes:
but it is my duty to hear nothing that it pleases not my Lord I should
hear.&nbsp; Attend the Prince to his chamber.&nbsp; I will retire to
my oratory, and pray to the blessed Virgin to inspire you with her holy
counsels, and to restore the heart of my gracious Lord to its wonted
peace and gentleness.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Excellent woman!&rdquo; said the Friar.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,
I attend your pleasure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, accompanied by the Friar, passed to his own apartment, where
shutting the door, &ldquo;I perceive, Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
Isabella has acquainted you with my purpose.&nbsp; Now hear my resolve,
and obey.&nbsp; Reasons of state, most urgent reasons, my own and the
safety of my people, demand that I should have a son.&nbsp; It is in
vain to expect an heir from Hippolita.&nbsp; I have made choice of Isabella.&nbsp;
You must bring her back; and you must do more.&nbsp; I know the influence
you have with Hippolita: her conscience is in your hands.&nbsp; She
is, I allow, a faultless woman: her soul is set on heaven, and scorns
the little grandeur of this world: you can withdraw her from it entirely.&nbsp;
Persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our marriage, and to retire
into a monastery - she shall endow one if she will; and she shall have
the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you can wish.&nbsp;
Thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over our heads,
and have the merit of saying the principality of Otranto from destruction.&nbsp;
You are a prudent man, and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me
into some unbecoming expressions, I honour your virtue, and wish to
be indebted to you for the repose of my life and the preservation of
my family.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The will of heaven be done!&rdquo; said the Friar.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am but its worthless instrument.&nbsp; It makes use of my tongue to
tell thee, Prince, of thy unwarrantable designs.&nbsp; The injuries
of the virtuous Hippolita have mounted to the throne of pity.&nbsp;
By me thou art reprimanded for thy adulterous intention of repudiating
her: by me thou art warned not to pursue the incestuous design on thy
contracted daughter.&nbsp; Heaven that delivered her from thy fury,
when the judgments so recently fallen on thy house ought to have inspired
thee with other thoughts, will continue to watch over her.&nbsp; Even
I, a poor and despised Friar, am able to protect her from thy violence
- I, sinner as I am, and uncharitably reviled by your Highness as an
accomplice of I know not what amours, scorn the allurements with which
it has pleased thee to tempt mine honesty.&nbsp; I love my order; I
honour devout souls; I respect the piety of thy Princess - but I will
not betray the confidence she reposes in me, nor serve even the cause
of religion by foul and sinful compliances - but forsooth! the welfare
of the state depends on your Highness having a son!&nbsp; Heaven mocks
the short-sighted views of man.&nbsp; But yester-morn, whose house was
so great, so flourishing as Manfred&rsquo;s? - where is young Conrad
now? - My Lord, I respect your tears - but I mean not to check them
- let them flow, Prince!&nbsp; They will weigh more with heaven toward
the welfare of thy subjects, than a marriage, which, founded on lust
or policy, could never prosper.&nbsp; The sceptre, which passed from
the race of Alfonso to thine, cannot be preserved by a match which the
church will never allow.&nbsp; If it is the will of the Most High that
Manfred&rsquo;s name must perish, resign yourself, my Lord, to its decrees;
and thus deserve a crown that can never pass away.&nbsp; Come, my Lord;
I like this sorrow - let us return to the Princess: she is not apprised
of your cruel intentions; nor did I mean more than to alarm you.&nbsp;
You saw with what gentle patience, with what efforts of love, she heard,
she rejected hearing, the extent of your guilt.&nbsp; I know she longs
to fold you in her arms, and assure you of her unalterable affection.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;you mistake my compunction:
true, I honour Hippolita&rsquo;s virtues; I think her a Saint; and wish
it were for my soul&rsquo;s health to tie faster the knot that has united
us - but alas! Father, you know not the bitterest of my pangs! it is
some time that I have had scruples on the legality of our union: Hippolita
is related to me in the fourth degree - it is true, we had a dispensation:
but I have been informed that she had also been contracted to another.&nbsp;
This it is that sits heavy at my heart: to this state of unlawful wedlock
I impute the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of Conrad!
- ease my conscience of this burden: dissolve our marriage, and accomplish
the work of godliness - which your divine exhortations have commenced
in my soul.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt, when he perceived
this turn in the wily Prince!&nbsp; He trembled for Hippolita, whose
ruin he saw was determined; and he feared if Manfred had no hope of
recovering Isabella, that his impatience for a son would direct him
to some other object, who might not be equally proof against the temptation
of Manfred&rsquo;s rank.&nbsp; For some time the holy man remained absorbed
in thought.&nbsp; At length, conceiving some hopes from delay, he thought
the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from despairing of
recovering Isabella.&nbsp; Her the Friar knew he could dispose, from
her affection to Hippolita, and from the aversion she had expressed
to him for Manfred&rsquo;s addresses, to second his views, till the
censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce.&nbsp;
With this intention, as if struck with the Prince&rsquo;s scruples,
he at length said:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord, I have been pondering on what your Highness has said;
and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive
of your repugnance to your virtuous Lady, far be it from me to endeavour
to harden your heart.&nbsp; The church is an indulgent mother: unfold
your griefs to her: she alone can administer comfort to your soul, either
by satisfying your conscience, or upon examination of your scruples,
by setting you at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful means of
continuing your lineage.&nbsp; In the latter case, if the Lady Isabella
can be brought to consent - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, who concluded that he had either over-reached the good man,
or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance,
was overjoyed at this sudden turn, and repeated the most magnificent
promises, if he should succeed by the Friar&rsquo;s mediation.&nbsp;
The well-meaning priest suffered him to deceive himself, fully determined
to traverse his views, instead of seconding them.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Since we now understand one another,&rdquo; resumed the Prince,
&ldquo;I expect, Father, that you satisfy me in one point.&nbsp; Who
is the youth that I found in the vault?&nbsp; He must have been privy
to Isabella&rsquo;s flight: tell me truly, is he her lover? or is he
an agent for another&rsquo;s passion?&nbsp; I have often suspected Isabella&rsquo;s
indifference to my son: a thousand circumstances crowd on my mind that
confirm that suspicion.&nbsp; She herself was so conscious of it, that
while I discoursed her in the gallery, she outran my suspicious, and
endeavoured to justify herself from coolness to Conrad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Friar, who knew nothing of the youth, but what he had learnt occasionally
from the Princess, ignorant what was become of him, and not sufficiently
reflecting on the impetuosity of Manfred&rsquo;s temper, conceived that
it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind: they
might be turned to some use hereafter, either by prejudicing the Prince
against Isabella, if he persisted in that union or by diverting his
attention to a wrong scent, and employing his thoughts on a visionary
intrigue, prevent his engaging in any new pursuit.&nbsp; With this unhappy
policy, he answered in a manner to confirm Manfred in the belief of
some connection between Isabella and the youth.&nbsp; The Prince, whose
passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze, fell into a
rage at the idea of what the Friar suggested.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&ldquo;I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue,&rdquo; cried
he; and quitting Jerome abruptly, with a command to remain there till
his return, he hastened to the great hall of the castle, and ordered
the peasant to be brought before him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou hardened young impostor!&rdquo; said the Prince, as soon
as he saw the youth; &ldquo;what becomes of thy boasted veracity now?
it was Providence, was it, and the light of the moon, that discovered
the lock of the trap-door to thee?&nbsp; Tell me, audacious boy, who
thou art, and how long thou hast been acquainted with the Princess -
and take care to answer with less equivocation than thou didst last
night, or tortures shall wring the truth from thee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The young man, perceiving that his share in the flight of the Princess
was discovered, and concluding that anything he should say could no
longer be of any service or detriment to her, replied -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am no impostor, my Lord, nor have I deserved opprobrious language.&nbsp;
I answered to every question your Highness put to me last night with
the same veracity that I shall speak now: and that will not be from
fear of your tortures, but because my soul abhors a falsehood.&nbsp;
Please to repeat your questions, my Lord; I am ready to give you all
the satisfaction in my power.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You know my questions,&rdquo; replied the Prince, &ldquo;and
only want time to prepare an evasion.&nbsp; Speak directly; who art
thou? and how long hast thou been known to the Princess?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am a labourer at the next village,&rdquo; said the peasant;
&ldquo;my name is Theodore.&nbsp; The Princess found me in the vault
last night: before that hour I never was in her presence.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I may believe as much or as little as I please of this,&rdquo;
said Manfred; &ldquo;but I will hear thy own story before I examine
into the truth of it.&nbsp; Tell me, what reason did the Princess give
thee for making her escape? thy life depends on thy answer.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She told me,&rdquo; replied Theodore, &ldquo;that she was on
the brink of destruction, and that if she could not escape from the
castle, she was in danger in a few moments of being made miserable for
ever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And on this slight foundation, on a silly girl&rsquo;s report,&rdquo;
said Manfred, &ldquo;thou didst hazard my displeasure?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I fear no man&rsquo;s displeasure,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;when
a woman in distress puts herself under my protection.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
During this examination, Matilda was going to the apartment of Hippolita.&nbsp;
At the upper end of the hall, where Manfred sat, was a boarded gallery
with latticed windows, through which Matilda and Bianca were to pass.&nbsp;
Hearing her father&rsquo;s voice, and seeing the servants assembled
round him, she stopped to learn the occasion.&nbsp; The prisoner soon
drew her attention: the steady and composed manner in which he answered,
and the gallantry of his last reply, which were the first words she
heard distinctly, interested her in his flavour.&nbsp; His person was
noble, handsome, and commanding, even in that situation: but his countenance
soon engrossed her whole care.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heavens!&nbsp; Bianca,&rdquo; said the Princess softly, &ldquo;do
I dream? or is not that youth the exact resemblance of Alfonso&rsquo;s
picture in the gallery?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She could say no more, for her father&rsquo;s voice grew louder at every
word.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This bravado,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;surpasses all thy former
insolence.&nbsp; Thou shalt experience the wrath with which thou darest
to trifle.&nbsp; Seize him,&rdquo; continued Manfred, &ldquo;and &lsquo;bind
him - the first news the Princess hears of her champion shall be, that
he has lost his head for her sake.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The injustice of which thou art guilty towards me,&rdquo; said
Theodore, &ldquo;convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering
the Princess from thy tyranny.&nbsp; May she be happy, whatever becomes
of me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is a lover!&rdquo; cried Manfred in a rage: &ldquo;a peasant
within sight of death is not animated by such sentiments.&nbsp; Tell
me, tell me, rash boy, who thou art, or the rack shall force thy secret
from thee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou hast threatened me with death already,&rdquo; said the youth,
&ldquo;for the truth I have told thee: if that is all the encouragement
I am to expect for sincerity, I am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity
farther.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then thou wilt not speak?&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; replied he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bear him away into the courtyard,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;I
will see his head this instant severed from his body.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Matilda fainted at hearing those words.&nbsp; Bianca shrieked, and cried
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Help! help! the Princess is dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; Manfred started
at this ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter!&nbsp; The young
peasant, who heard it too, was struck with horror, and asked eagerly
the same question; but Manfred ordered him to be hurried into the court,
and kept there for execution, till he had informed himself of the cause
of Bianca&rsquo;s shrieks.&nbsp; When he learned the meaning, he treated
it as a womanish panic, and ordering Matilda to be carried to her apartment,
he rushed into the court, and calling for one of his guards, bade Theodore
kneel down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow.<br>
<br>
The undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation
that touched every heart but Manfred&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He wished earnestly
to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess;
but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her, he desisted.&nbsp;
The only boon he deigned to ask was, that he might be permitted to have
a confessor, and make his peace with heaven.&nbsp; Manfred, who hoped
by the confessor&rsquo;s means to come at the youth&rsquo;s history,
readily granted his request; and being convinced that Father Jerome
was now in his interest, he ordered him to be called and shrive the
prisoner.&nbsp; The holy man, who had little foreseen the catastrophe
that his imprudence occasioned, fell on his knees to the Prince, and
adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood.&nbsp;
He accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion, endeavoured
to disculpate the youth, and left no method untried to soften the tyrant&rsquo;s
rage.&nbsp; Manfred, more incensed than appeased by Jerome&rsquo;s intercession,
whose retraction now made him suspect he had been imposed upon by both,
commanded the Friar to do his duty, telling him he would not allow the
prisoner many minutes for confession.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nor do I ask many, my Lord,&rdquo; said the unhappy young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My sins, thank heaven, have not been numerous; nor exceed what
might be expected at my years.&nbsp; Dry your tears, good Father, and
let us despatch.&nbsp; This is a bad world; nor have I had cause to
leave it with regret.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh wretched youth!&rdquo; said Jerome; &ldquo;how canst thou
bear the sight of me with patience?&nbsp; I am thy murderer! it is I
have brought this dismal hour upon thee!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I forgive thee from my soul,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;as
I hope heaven will pardon me.&nbsp; Hear my confession, Father; and
give me thy blessing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How can I prepare thee for thy passage as I ought?&rdquo; said
Jerome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou canst not be saved without pardoning thy foes
- and canst thou forgive that impious man there?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And does not this touch thee, cruel Prince?&rdquo; said the Friar.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I sent for thee to confess him,&rdquo; said Manfred, sternly;
&ldquo;not to plead for him.&nbsp; Thou didst first incense me against
him - his blood be upon thy head!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It will! it will!&rdquo; said the good main, in an agony of sorrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou and I must never hope to go where this blessed youth is
going!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Despatch!&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;I am no more to be moved
by the whining of priests than by the shrieks of women.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;is it possible that my fate
could have occasioned what I heard!&nbsp; Is the Princess then again
in thy power?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou dost but remember me of my wrath,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Prepare thee, for this moment is thy last.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The youth, who felt his indignation rise, and who was touched with the
sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators, as well
as into the Friar, suppressed his emotions, and putting off his doublet,
and unbuttoning, his collar, knelt down to his prayers.&nbsp; As he
stooped, his shirt slipped down below his shoulder, and discovered the
mark of a bloody arrow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; cried the holy man, starting; &ldquo;what
do I see?&nbsp; It is my child! my Theodore!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The passions that ensued must be conceived; they cannot be painted.&nbsp;
The tears of the assistants were suspended by wonder, rather than stopped
by joy.&nbsp; They seemed to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what
they ought to feel.&nbsp; Surprise, doubt, tenderness, respect, succeeded
each other in the countenance of the youth.&nbsp; He received with modest
submission the effusion of the old man&rsquo;s tears and embraces.&nbsp;
Yet afraid of giving a loose to hope, and suspecting from what had passed
the inflexibility of Manfred&rsquo;s temper, he cast a glance towards
the Prince, as if to say, canst thou be unmoved at such a scene as this?<br>
<br>
Manfred&rsquo;s heart was capable of being touched.&nbsp; He forgot
his anger in his astonishment; yet his pride forbad his owning himself
affected.&nbsp; He even doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance
of the Friar to save the youth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What may this mean?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can he be
thy son?&nbsp; Is it consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity
to avow a peasant&rsquo;s offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; said the holy man, &ldquo;dost thou question
his being mine?&nbsp; Could I feel the anguish I do if I were not his
father?&nbsp; Spare him! good Prince! spare him! and revile me as thou
pleasest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Spare him! spare him!&rdquo; cried the attendants; &ldquo;for
this good man&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said Manfred, sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must know
more ere I am disposed to pardon.&nbsp; A Saint&rsquo;s bastard may
be no saint himself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Injurious Lord!&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;add not insult to
cruelty.&nbsp; If I am this venerable man&rsquo;s son, though no Prince,
as thou art, know the blood that flows in my veins - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Friar, interrupting him, &ldquo;his blood
is noble; nor is he that abject thing, my Lord, you speak him.&nbsp;
He is my lawful son, and Sicily can boast of few houses more ancient
than that of Falconara.&nbsp; But alas! my Lord, what is blood! what
is nobility!&nbsp; We are all reptiles, miserable, sinful creatures.&nbsp;
It is piety alone that can distinguish us from the dust whence we sprung,
and whither we must return.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Truce to your sermon,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;you forget
you are no longer Friar Jerome, but the Count of Falconara.&nbsp; Let
me know your history; you will have time to moralise hereafter, if you
should not happen to obtain the grace of that sturdy criminal there.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mother of God!&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;is it possible my
Lord can refuse a father the life of his only, his long-lost, child!&nbsp;
Trample me, my Lord, scorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but
spare my son!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou canst feel, then,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;what it is
to lose an only son!&nbsp; A little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation
to me: <i>my</i> house, if fate so pleased, must perish - but the Count
of Falconara - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! my Lord,&rdquo; said Jerome, &ldquo;I confess I have offended;
but aggravate not an old man&rsquo;s sufferings!&nbsp; I boast not of
my family, nor think of such vanities - it is nature, that pleads for
this boy; it is the memory of the dear woman that bore him.&nbsp; Is
she, Theodore, is she dead?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Her soul has long been with the blessed,&rdquo; said Theodore.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! how?&rdquo; cried Jerome, &ldquo;tell me - no - she is happy!&nbsp;
Thou art all my care now! - Most dread Lord! will you - will you grant
me my poor boy&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Return to thy convent,&rdquo; answered Manfred; &ldquo;conduct
the Princess hither; obey me in what else thou knowest; and I promise
thee the life of thy son.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! my Lord,&rdquo; said Jerome, &ldquo;is my honesty the price
I must pay for this dear youth&rsquo;s safety?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; cried Theodore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me die a thousand
deaths, rather than stain thy conscience.&nbsp; What is it the tyrant
would exact of thee?&nbsp; Is the Princess still safe from his power?&nbsp;
Protect her, thou venerable old man; and let all the weight of his wrath
fall on me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth; and ere Manfred
could reply, the trampling of horses was heard, and a brazen trumpet,
which hung without the gate of the castle, was suddenly sounded.&nbsp;
At the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet, which
still remained at the other end of the court, were tempestuously agitated,
and nodded thrice, as if bowed by some invisible wearer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Manfred&rsquo;s heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the
miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen
trumpet.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said he to Jerome, whom he now ceased to treat
as Count of Falconara, &ldquo;what mean these portents?&nbsp; If I have
offended - &rdquo; the plumes were shaken with greater violence than
before.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Unhappy Prince that I am,&rdquo; cried Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy
Father! will you not assist me with your prayers?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; replied Jerome, &ldquo;heaven is no doubt displeased
with your mockery of its servants.&nbsp; Submit yourself to the church;
and cease to persecute her ministers.&nbsp; Dismiss this innocent youth;
and learn to respect the holy character I wear.&nbsp; Heaven will not
be trifled with: you see - &rdquo; the trumpet sounded again.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I acknowledge I have been too hasty,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Father, do you go to the wicket, and demand who is at the gate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you grant me the life of Theodore?&rdquo; replied the Friar.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;but inquire who is without!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome, falling on the neck of his son, discharged a flood of tears,
that spoke the fulness of his soul.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You promised to go to the gate,&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; replied the Friar, &ldquo;your Highness would
excuse my thanking you first in this tribute of my heart.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Go, dearest Sir,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;obey the Prince.&nbsp;
I do not deserve that you should delay his satisfaction for me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome, inquiring who was without, was answered, &ldquo;A Herald.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;From whom?&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;From the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre,&rdquo; said the Herald;
&ldquo;and I must speak with the usurper of Otranto.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome returned to the Prince, and did not fail to repeat the message
in the very words it had been uttered.&nbsp; The first sounds struck
Manfred with terror; but when he heard himself styled usurper, his rage
rekindled, and all his courage revived.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Usurper! - insolent villain!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;who dares
to question my title?&nbsp; Retire, Father; this is no business for
Monks: I will meet this presumptuous man myself.&nbsp; Go to your convent
and prepare the Princess&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; Your son shall be a hostage
for your fidelity: his life depends on your obedience.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good heaven! my Lord,&rdquo; cried Jerome, &ldquo;your Highness
did but this instant freely pardon my child - have you so soon forgot
the interposition of heaven?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heaven,&rdquo; replied Manfred, &ldquo;does not send Heralds
to question the title of a lawful Prince.&nbsp; I doubt whether it even
notifies its will through Friars - but that is your affair, not mine.&nbsp;
At present you know my pleasure; and it is not a saucy Herald that shall
save your son, if you do not return with the Princess.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was in vain for the holy man to reply.&nbsp; Manfred commanded him
to be conducted to the postern-gate, and shut out from the castle.&nbsp;
And he ordered some of his attendants to carry Theodore to the top of
the black tower, and guard him strictly; scarce permitting the father
and son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting.&nbsp; He then withdrew
to the hall, and seating himself in princely state, ordered the Herald
to be admitted to his presence.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well! thou insolent!&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;what wouldst
thou with me?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I come,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;to thee, Manfred, usurper of
the principality of Otranto, from the renowned and invincible Knight,
the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre: in the name of his Lord, Frederic,
Marquis of Vicenza, he demands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that Prince,
whom thou hast basely and traitorously got into thy power, by bribing
her false guardians during his absence; and he requires thee to resign
the principality of Otranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord
Frederic, the nearest of blood to the last rightful Lord, Alfonso the
Good.&nbsp; If thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands,
he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so saying the Herald cast down his warder.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And where is this braggart who sends thee?&rdquo; said Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;At the distance of a league,&rdquo; said the Herald: &ldquo;he
comes to make good his Lord&rsquo;s claim against thee, as he is a true
knight, and thou an usurper and ravisher.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Injurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was not his
interest to provoke the Marquis.&nbsp; He knew how well founded the
claim of Frederic was; nor was this the first time he had heard of it.&nbsp;
Frederic&rsquo;s ancestors had assumed the style of Princes of Otranto,
from the death of Alfonso the Good without issue; but Manfred, his father,
and grandfather, had been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to dispossess
them.&nbsp; Frederic, a martial and amorous young Prince, had married
a beautiful young lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had died in
childbed of Isabella.&nbsp; Her death affected him so much that he had
taken the cross and gone to the Holy Land, where he was wounded in an
engagement against the infidels, made prisoner, and reported to be dead.&nbsp;
When the news reached Manfred&rsquo;s ears, he bribed the guardians
of the Lady Isabella to deliver her up to him as a bride for his son
Conrad, by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the
two houses.&nbsp; This motive, on Conrad&rsquo;s death, had co-operated
to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself; and the same
reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent
of Frederic to this marriage.&nbsp; A like policy inspired him with
the thought of inviting Frederic&rsquo;s champion into the castle, lest
he should be informed of Isabella&rsquo;s flight, which he strictly
enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight&rsquo;s
retinue.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Herald,&rdquo; said Manfred, as soon as he had digested these
reflections, &ldquo;return to thy master, and tell him, ere we liquidate
our differences by the sword, Manfred would hold some converse with
him.&nbsp; Bid him welcome to my castle, where by my faith, as I am
a true Knight, he shall have courteous reception, and full security
for himself and followers.&nbsp; If we cannot adjust our quarrel by
amicable means, I swear he shall depart in safety, and shall have full
satisfaction according to the laws of arms: So help me God and His holy
Trinity!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Herald made three obeisances and retired.<br>
<br>
During this interview Jerome&rsquo;s mind was agitated by a thousand
contrary passions.&nbsp; He trembled for the life of his son, and his
first thought was to persuade Isabella to return to the castle.&nbsp;
Yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with Manfred.&nbsp;
He dreaded Hippolita&rsquo;s unbounded submission to the will of her
Lord; and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to
consent to a divorce, if he could get access to her; yet should Manfred
discover that the obstruction came from him, it might be equally fatal
to Theodore.&nbsp; He was impatient to know whence came the Herald,
who with so little management had questioned the title of Manfred: yet
he did not dare absent himself from the convent, lest Isabella should
leave it, and her flight be imputed to him.&nbsp; He returned disconsolately
to the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to resolve.&nbsp; A Monk,
who met him in the porch and observed his melancholy air, said -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! brother, is it then true that we have lost our excellent
Princess Hippolita?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The holy man started, and cried, &ldquo;What meanest thou, brother?&nbsp;
I come this instant from the castle, and left her in perfect health.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Martelli,&rdquo; replied the other Friar, &ldquo;passed by the
convent but a quarter of an hour ago on his way from the castle, and
reported that her Highness was dead.&nbsp; All our brethren are gone
to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better life, and willed
me to wait thy arrival.&nbsp; They know thy holy attachment to that
good Lady, and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in thee
- indeed we have all reason to weep; she was a mother to our house.&nbsp;
But this life is but a pilgrimage; we must not murmur - we shall all
follow her!&nbsp; May our end be like hers!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&ldquo;Good brother, thou dreamest,&rdquo; said Jerome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I tell thee I come from the castle, and left the Princess well.&nbsp;
Where is the Lady Isabella?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Poor Gentlewoman!&rdquo; replied the Friar; &ldquo;I told her
the sad news, and offered her spiritual comfort.&nbsp; I reminded her
of the transitory condition of mortality, and advised her to take the
veil: I quoted the example of the holy Princess Sanchia of Arragon.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thy zeal was laudable,&rdquo; said Jerome, impatiently; &ldquo;but
at present it was unnecessary: Hippolita is well - at least I trust
in the Lord she is; I heard nothing to the contrary - yet, methinks,
the Prince&rsquo;s earnestness - Well, brother, but where is the Lady
Isabella?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;she wept much, and
said she would retire to her chamber.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome left his comrade abruptly, and hastened to the Princess, but
she was not in her chamber.&nbsp; He inquired of the domestics of the
convent, but could learn no news of her.&nbsp; He searched in vain throughout
the monastery and the church, and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood,
to get intelligence if she had been seen; but to no purpose.&nbsp; Nothing
could equal the good man&rsquo;s perplexity.&nbsp; He judged that Isabella,
suspecting Manfred of having precipitated his wife&rsquo;s death, had
taken the alarm, and withdrawn herself to some more secret place of
concealment.&nbsp; This new flight would probably carry the Prince&rsquo;s
fury to the height.&nbsp; The report of Hippolita&rsquo;s death, though
it seemed almost incredible, increased his consternation; and though
Isabella&rsquo;s escape bespoke her aversion of Manfred for a husband,
Jerome could feel no comfort from it, while it endangered the life of
his son.&nbsp; He determined to return to the castle, and made several
of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to Manfred, and,
if necessary, join their intercession with his for Theodore.<br>
<br>
The Prince, in the meantime, had passed into the court, and ordered
the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger
Knight and his train.&nbsp; In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived.&nbsp;
First came two harbingers with wands.&nbsp; Next a herald, followed
by two pages and two trumpets.&nbsp; Then a hundred foot-guards.&nbsp;
These were attended by as many horse.&nbsp; After them fifty footmen,
clothed in scarlet and black, the colours of the Knight.&nbsp; Then
a led horse.&nbsp; Two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback
bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and Otranto quarterly - a
circumstance that much offended Manfred - but he stifled his resentment.&nbsp;
Two more pages.&nbsp; The Knight&rsquo;s confessor telling his beads.&nbsp;
Fifty more footmen clad as before.&nbsp; Two Knights habited in complete
armour, their beavers down, comrades to the principal Knight.&nbsp;
The squires of the two Knights, carrying their shields and devices.&nbsp;
The Knight&rsquo;s own squire.&nbsp; A hundred gentlemen bearing an
enormous sword, and seeming to faint under the weight of it.&nbsp; The
Knight himself on a chestnut steed, in complete armour, his lance in
the rest, his face entirely concealed by his vizor, which was surmounted
by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers.&nbsp; Fifty foot-guards
with drums and trumpets closed the procession, which wheeled off to
the right and left to make room for the principal Knight.<br>
<br>
As soon as he approached the gate he stopped; and the herald advancing,
read again the words of the challenge.&nbsp; Manfred&rsquo;s eyes were
fixed on the gigantic sword, and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel:
but his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind
him.&nbsp; He turned and beheld the Plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated
in the same extraordinary manner as before.&nbsp; It required intrepidity
like Manfred&rsquo;s not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances
that seemed to announce his fate.&nbsp; Yet scorning in the presence
of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested, he said
boldly -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome.&nbsp; If thou
art of mortal mould, thy valour shall meet its equal: and if thou art
a true Knight, thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point.&nbsp;
Be these omens from heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to the righteousness
of his cause and to the aid of St. Nicholas, who has ever protected
his house.&nbsp; Alight, Sir Knight, and repose thyself.&nbsp; To-morrow
thou shalt have a fair field, and heaven befriend the juster side!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by Manfred
to the great hall of the castle.&nbsp; As they traversed the court,
the Knight stopped to gaze on the miraculous casque; and kneeling down,
seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes.&nbsp; Rising, he made a sign
to the Prince to lead on.&nbsp; As soon as they entered the hall, Manfred
proposed to the stranger to disarm, but the Knight shook his head in
token of refusal.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;this is not courteous,
but by my good faith I will not cross thee, nor shalt thou have cause
to complain of the Prince of Otranto.&nbsp; No treachery is designed
on my part; I hope none is intended on thine; here take my gage&rdquo;
(giving him his ring): &ldquo;your friends and you shall enjoy the laws
of hospitality.&nbsp; Rest here until refreshments are brought.&nbsp;
I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train, and return
to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three Knights bowed as accepting his courtesy.&nbsp;
Manfred directed the stranger&rsquo;s retinue to be conducted to an
adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception
of pilgrims.&nbsp; As they made the circuit of the court to return towards
the gate, the gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling
to the ground opposite to the helmet, remained immovable.&nbsp; Manfred,
almost hardened to preternatural appearances, surmounted the shock of
this new prodigy; and returning to the hall, where by this time the
feast was ready, he invited his silent guests to take their places.&nbsp;
Manfred, however ill his heart was at ease, endeavoured to inspire the
company with mirth.&nbsp; He put several questions to them, but was
answered only by signs.&nbsp; They raised their vizors but sufficiently
to feed themselves, and that sparingly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sirs&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;ye are the first guests I
ever treated within these walls who scorned to hold any intercourse
with me: nor has it oft been customary, I ween, for princes to hazard
their state and dignity against strangers and mutes.&nbsp; You say you
come in the name of Frederic of Vicenza; I have ever heard that he was
a gallant and courteous Knight; nor would he, I am bold to say, think
it beneath him to mix in social converse with a Prince that is his equal,
and not unknown by deeds in arms.&nbsp; Still ye are silent - well!
be it as it may - by the laws of hospitality and chivalry ye are masters
under this roof: ye shall do your pleasure.&nbsp; But come, give me
a goblet of wine; ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of
your fair mistresses.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The principal Knight sighed and crossed himself, and was rising from
the board.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;what I said was but in
sport.&nbsp; I shall constrain you in nothing: use your good liking.&nbsp;
Since mirth is not your mood, let us be sad.&nbsp; Business may hit
your fancies better.&nbsp; Let us withdraw, and hear if what I have
to unfold may be better relished than the vain efforts I have made for
your pastime.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber, shut
the door, and inviting them to be seated, began thus, addressing himself
to the chief personage:-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis
of Vicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella, his daughter, who has been
contracted in the face of Holy Church to my son, by the consent of her
legal guardians; and to require me to resign my dominions to your Lord,
who gives himself for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso, whose
soul God rest!&nbsp; I shall speak to the latter article of your demands
first.&nbsp; You must know, your Lord knows, that I enjoy the principality
of Otranto from my father, Don Manuel, as he received it from his father,
Don Ricardo.&nbsp; Alfonso, their predecessor, dying childless in the
Holy Land, bequeathed his estates to my grandfather, Don Ricardo, in
consideration of his faithful services.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger shook
his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Manfred, warmly, &ldquo;Ricardo was a
valiant and upright man; he was a pious man; witness his munificent
foundation of the adjoining church and two converts.&nbsp; He was peculiarly
patronised by St. Nicholas - my grandfather was incapable - I say, Sir,
Don Ricardo was incapable - excuse me, your interruption has disordered
me.&nbsp; I venerate the memory of my grandfather.&nbsp; Well, Sirs,
he held this estate; he held it by his good sword and by the favour
of St. Nicholas - so did my father; and so, Sirs, will I, come what
come will.&nbsp; But Frederic, your Lord, is nearest in blood.&nbsp;
I have consented to put my title to the issue of the sword.&nbsp; Does
that imply a vicious title?&nbsp; I might have asked, where is Frederic
your Lord?&nbsp; Report speaks him dead in captivity.&nbsp; You say,
your actions say, he lives - I question it not - I might, Sirs, I might
- but I do not.&nbsp; Other Princes would bid Frederic take his inheritance
by force, if he can: they would not stake their dignity on a single
combat: they would not submit it to the decision of unknown mutes! -
pardon me, gentlemen, I am too warm: but suppose yourselves in my situation:
as ye are stout Knights, would it not move your choler to have your
own and the honour of your ancestors called in question?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But to the point.&nbsp; Ye require me to deliver up the Lady
Isabella.&nbsp; Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorised to receive her?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Knight nodded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Receive her,&rdquo; continued Manfred; &ldquo;well, you are authorised
to receive her, but, gentle Knight, may I ask if you have full powers?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Knight nodded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;then hear what I
have to offer.&nbsp; Ye see, gentlemen, before you, the most unhappy
of men!&rdquo; (he began to weep); &ldquo;afford me your compassion;
I am entitled to it, indeed I am.&nbsp; Know, I have lost my only hope,
my joy, the support of my house - Conrad died yester morning.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Knights discovered signs of surprise.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son.&nbsp; Isabella is at
liberty.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you then restore her?&rdquo; cried the chief Knight, breaking
silence.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Afford me your patience,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
rejoice to find, by this testimony of your goodwill, that this matter
may be adjusted without blood.&nbsp; It is no interest of mine dictates
what little I have farther to say.&nbsp; Ye behold in me a man disgusted
with the world: the loss of my son has weaned me from earthly cares.&nbsp;
Power and greatness have no longer any charms in my eyes.&nbsp; I wished
to transmit the sceptre I had received from my ancestors with honour
to my son - but that is over!&nbsp; Life itself is so indifferent to
me, that I accepted your defiance with joy.&nbsp; A good Knight cannot
go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his vocation:
whatever is the will of heaven, I submit; for alas! Sirs, I am a man
of many sorrows.&nbsp; Manfred is no object of envy, but no doubt you
are acquainted with my story.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Knight made signs of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred
proceed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it possible, Sirs,&rdquo; continued the Prince, &ldquo;that
my story should be a secret to you?&nbsp; Have you heard nothing relating
to me and the Princess Hippolita?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
They shook their heads.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Thus, then, Sirs, it is.&nbsp; You think me ambitious:
ambition, alas! is composed of more rugged materials.&nbsp; If I were
ambitious, I should not for so many years have been a prey to all the
hell of conscientious scruples.&nbsp; But I weary your patience: I will
be brief.&nbsp; Know, then, that I have long been troubled in mind on
my union with the Princess Hippolita.&nbsp; Oh! Sirs, if ye were acquainted
with that excellent woman! if ye knew that I adore her like a mistress,
and cherish her as a friend - but man was not born for perfect happiness!&nbsp;
She shares my scruples, and with her consent I have brought this matter
before the church, for we are related within the forbidden degrees.&nbsp;
I expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate us for
ever - I am sure you feel for me - I see you do - pardon these tears!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would end.<br>
<br>
Manfred continued -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety,
I thought of nothing but resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever
from the sight of mankind.&nbsp; My only difficulty was to fix on a
successor, who would be tender of my people, and to dispose of the Lady
Isabella, who is dear to me as my own blood.&nbsp; I was willing to
restore the line of Alfonso, even in his most distant kindred.&nbsp;
And though, pardon me, I am satisfied it was his will that Ricardo&rsquo;s
lineage should take place of his own relations; yet where was I to search
for those relations?&nbsp; I knew of none but Frederic, your Lord; he
was a captive to the infidels, or dead; and were he living, and at home,
would he quit the flourishing State of Vicenza for the inconsiderable
principality of Otranto?&nbsp; If he would not, could I bear the thought
of seeing a hard, unfeeling, Viceroy set over my poor faithful people?
for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am beloved by them.&nbsp;
But ye will ask whither tends this long discourse?&nbsp; Briefly, then,
thus, Sirs.&nbsp; Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a remedy
for these difficulties and my misfortunes.&nbsp; The Lady Isabella is
at liberty; I shall soon be so.&nbsp; I would submit to anything for
the good of my people.&nbsp; Were it not the best, the only way to extinguish
the feuds between our families, if I was to take the Lady Isabella to
wife?&nbsp; You start.&nbsp; But though Hippolita&rsquo;s virtues will
ever be dear to me, a Prince must not consider himself; he is born for
his people.&rdquo;&nbsp; A servant at that instant entering the chamber
apprised Manfred that Jerome and several of his brethren demanded immediate
access to him.<br>
<br>
The Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar
would discover to the strangers that Isabella had taken sanctuary, was
going to forbid Jerome&rsquo;s entrance.&nbsp; But recollecting that
he was certainly arrived to notify the Princess&rsquo;s return, Manfred
began to excuse himself to the Knights for leaving them for a few moments,
but was prevented by the arrival of the Friars.&nbsp; Manfred angrily
reprimanded them for their intrusion, and would have forced them back
from the chamber; but Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed.&nbsp;
He declared aloud the flight of Isabella, with protestations of his
own innocence.<br>
<br>
Manfred, distracted at the news, and not less at its coming to the knowledge
of the strangers, uttered nothing but incoherent sentences, now upbraiding
the Friar, now apologising to the Knights, earnest to know what was
become of Isabella, yet equally afraid of their knowing; impatient to
pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit.&nbsp; He
offered to despatch messengers in quest of her, but the chief Knight,
no longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred in bitter terms for his
dark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cause of Isabella&rsquo;s
first absence from the castle.&nbsp; Manfred, casting a stern look at
Jerome, implying a command of silence, pretended that on Conrad&rsquo;s
death he had placed her in sanctuary until he could determine how to
dispose of her.&nbsp; Jerome, who trembled for his son&rsquo;s life,
did not dare contradict this falsehood, but one of his brethren, not
under the same anxiety, declared frankly that she had fled to their
church in the preceding night.&nbsp; The Prince in vain endeavoured
to stop this discovery, which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion.&nbsp;
The principal stranger, amazed at the contradictions he heard, and more
than half persuaded that Manfred had secreted the Princess, notwithstanding
the concern he expressed at her flight, rushing to the door, said -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou traitor Prince!&nbsp; Isabella shall be found.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred endeavoured to hold him, but the other Knights assisting their
comrade, he broke from the Prince, and hastened into the court, demanding
his attendants.&nbsp; Manfred, finding it vain to divert him from the
pursuit, offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants, and
taking Jerome and some of the Friars to guide them, they issued from
the castle; Manfred privately giving orders to have the Knight&rsquo;s
company secured, while to the knight he affected to despatch a messenger
to require their assistance.<br>
<br>
The company had no sooner quitted the castle than Matilda, who felt
herself deeply interested for the young peasant, since she had seen
him condemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken
up with concerting measures to save him, was informed by some of the
female attendants that Manfred had despatched all his men various ways
in pursuit of Isabella.&nbsp; He had in his hurry given this order in
general terms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon
Theodore, but forgetting it.&nbsp; The domestics, officious to obey
so peremptory a Prince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of
novelty to join in any precipitate chase, had to a man left the castle.&nbsp;
Matilda disengaged herself from her women, stole up to the black tower,
and unbolting the door, presented herself to the astonished Theodore.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;though filial duty and womanly
modesty condemn the step I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting
all other ties, justifies this act.&nbsp; Fly; the doors of thy prison
are open: my father and his domestics are absent; but they may soon
return.&nbsp; Be gone in safety; and may the angels of heaven direct
thy course!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art surely one of those angels!&rdquo; said the enraptured
Theodore: &ldquo;none but a blessed saint could speak, could act - could
look - like thee.&nbsp; May I not know the name of my divine protectress?&nbsp;
Methought thou namedst thy father.&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; Can Manfred&rsquo;s
blood feel holy pity!&nbsp; Lovely Lady, thou answerest not.&nbsp; But
how art thou here thyself?&nbsp; Why dost thou neglect thy own safety,
and waste a thought on a wretch like Theodore?&nbsp; Let us fly together:
the life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy defence.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! thou mistakest,&rdquo; said Matilda, signing: &ldquo;I
am Manfred&rsquo;s daughter, but no dangers await me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Amazement!&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;but last night I blessed
myself for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably
returns me now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Still thou art in an error,&rdquo; said the Princess; &ldquo;but
this is no time for explanation.&nbsp; Fly, virtuous youth, while it
is in my power to save thee: should my father return, thou and I both
should indeed have cause to tremble.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;thinkest thou, charming maid,
that I will accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee?&nbsp;
Better I endured a thousand deaths.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I run no risk,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;but by thy delay.&nbsp;
Depart; it cannot be known that I have assisted thy flight.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Swear by the saints above,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;that
thou canst not be suspected; else here I vow to await whatever can befall
me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! thou art too generous,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;but rest
assured that no suspicion can alight on me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not deceive
me,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;and let me bathe it with the warm tears
of gratitude.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Forbear!&rdquo; said the Princess; &ldquo;this must not be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;I have never known but calamity
until this hour - perhaps shall never know other fortune again: suffer
the chaste raptures of holy gratitude: &rsquo;tis my soul would print
its effusions on thy hand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Forbear, and be gone,&rdquo; said Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would
Isabella approve of seeing thee at my feet?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who is Isabella?&rdquo; said the young man with surprise.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, me!&nbsp; I fear,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;I am serving
a deceitful one.&nbsp; Hast thou forgot thy curiosity this morning?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thy looks, thy actions, all thy beauteous self seem an emanation
of divinity,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;but thy words are dark and
mysterious.&nbsp; Speak, Lady; speak to thy servant&rsquo;s comprehension.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou understandest but too well!&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;but
once more I command thee to be gone: thy blood, which I may preserve,
will be on my head, if I waste the time in vain discourse.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I go, Lady,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;because it is thy will,
and because I would not bring the grey hairs of my father with sorrow
to the grave.&nbsp; Say but, adored Lady, that I have thy gentle pity.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;I will conduct thee to the
subterraneous vault by which Isabella escaped; it will lead thee to
the church of St. Nicholas, where thou mayst take sanctuary.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;was it another, and not thy
lovely self that I assisted to find the subterraneous passage?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;but ask no more; I tremble
to see thee still abide here; fly to the sanctuary.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To sanctuary,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;no, Princess; sanctuaries
are for helpless damsels, or for criminals.&nbsp; Theodore&rsquo;s soul
is free from guilt, nor will wear the appearance of it.&nbsp; Give me
a sword, Lady, and thy father shall learn that Theodore scorns an ignominious
flight.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Rash youth!&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;thou wouldst not dare
to lift thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of Otranto?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not against thy father; indeed, I dare not,&rdquo; said Theodore.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Excuse me, Lady; I had forgotten.&nbsp; But could I gaze on thee,
and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant Manfred!&nbsp; But he is
thy father, and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A deep and hollow groan, which seemed to come from above, startled the
Princess and Theodore.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good heaven! we are overheard!&rdquo; said the Princess.&nbsp;
They listened; but perceiving no further noise, they both concluded
it the effect of pent-up vapours.&nbsp; And the Princess, preceding
Theodore softly, carried him to her father&rsquo;s armoury, where, equipping
him with a complete suit, he was conducted by Matilda to the postern-gate.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Avoid the town,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;and all the
western side of the castle.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis there the search must be
making by Manfred and the strangers; but hie thee to the opposite quarter.&nbsp;
Yonder behind that forest to the east is a chain of rocks, hollowed
into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the sea coast.&nbsp; There
thou mayst lie concealed, till thou canst make signs to some vessel
to put on shore, and take thee off.&nbsp; Go! heaven be thy guide! -
and sometimes in thy prayers remember - Matilda!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Theodore flung himself at her feet, and seizing her lily hand, which
with struggles she suffered him to kiss, he vowed on the earliest opportunity
to get himself knighted, and fervently entreated her permission to swear
himself eternally her knight.&nbsp; Ere the Princess could reply, a
clap of thunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements.&nbsp;
Theodore, regardless of the tempest, would have urged his suit: but
the Princess, dismayed, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded
the youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed.&nbsp;
He sighed, and retired, but with eyes fixed on the gate, until Matilda,
closing it, put an end to an interview, in which the hearts of both
had drunk so deeply of a passion, which both now tasted for the first
time.<br>
<br>
Theodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his father with
his deliverance.&nbsp; There he learned the absence of Jerome, and the
pursuit that was making after the Lady Isabella, with some particulars
of whose story he now first became acquainted.&nbsp; The generous gallantry
of his nature prompted him to wish to assist her; but the Monks could
lend him no lights to guess at the route she had taken.&nbsp; He was
not tempted to wander far in search of her, for the idea of Matilda
had imprinted itself so strongly on his heart, that he could not bear
to absent himself at much distance from her abode.&nbsp; The tenderness
Jerome had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance; and
he even persuaded himself that filial affection was the chief cause
of his hovering between the castle and monastery.<br>
<br>
Until Jerome should return at night, Theodore at length determined to
repair to the forest that Matilda had pointed out to him.&nbsp; Arriving
there, he sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing
melancholy that reigned in his mind.&nbsp; In this mood he roved insensibly
to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and
were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits.&nbsp;
He recollected to have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and
adventurous disposition, he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring
the secret recesses of this labyrinth.&nbsp; He had not penetrated far
before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat
before him.<br>
<br>
Theodore, though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be
believed, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause
to the malice of the powers of darkness.&nbsp; He thought the place
more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents
who are reported to molest and bewilder travellers.&nbsp; He had long
burned with impatience to approve his valour.&nbsp; Drawing his sabre,
he marched sedately onwards, still directing his steps as the imperfect
rustling sound before him led the way.&nbsp; The armour he wore was
a like indication to the person who avoided him.&nbsp; Theodore, now
convinced that he was not mistaken, redoubled his pace, and evidently
gained on the person that fled, whose haste increasing, Theodore came
up just as a woman fell breathless before him.&nbsp; He hasted to raise
her, but her terror was so great that he apprehended she would faint
in his arms.&nbsp; He used every gentle word to dispel her alarms, and
assured her that far from injuring, he would defend her at the peril
of his life.&nbsp; The Lady recovering her spirits from his courteous
demeanour, and gazing on her protector, said -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sure, I have heard that voice before!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; replied Theodore; &ldquo;unless,
as I conjecture, thou art the Lady Isabella.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Merciful heaven!&rdquo; cried she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art not
sent in quest of me, art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; And saying those words,
she threw herself at his feet, and besought him not to deliver her up
to Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To Manfred!&rdquo; cried Theodore - &ldquo;no, Lady; I have once
already delivered thee from his tyranny, and it shall fare hard with
me now, but I will place thee out of the reach of his daring.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that thou shouldst be
the generous unknown whom I met last night in the vault of the castle?&nbsp;
Sure thou art not a mortal, but my guardian angel.&nbsp; On my knees,
let me thank - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hold! gentle Princess,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;nor demean
thyself before a poor and friendless young man.&nbsp; If heaven has
selected me for thy deliverer, it will accomplish its work, and strengthen
my arm in thy cause.&nbsp; But come, Lady, we are too near the mouth
of the cavern; let us seek its inmost recesses.&nbsp; I can have no
tranquillity till I have placed thee beyond the reach of danger.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! what mean you, sir?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
all your actions are noble, though your sentiments speak the purity
of your soul, is it fitting that I should accompany you alone into these
perplexed retreats?&nbsp; Should we be found together, what would a
censorious world think of my conduct?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I respect your virtuous delicacy,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;nor
do you harbour a suspicion that wounds my honour.&nbsp; I meant to conduct
you into the most private cavity of these rocks, and then at the hazard
of my life to guard their entrance against every living thing.&nbsp;
Besides, Lady,&rdquo; continued he, drawing a deep sigh, &ldquo;beauteous
and all perfect as your form is, and though my wishes are not guiltless
of aspiring, know, my soul is dedicated to another; and although - &rdquo;&nbsp;
A sudden noise prevented Theodore from proceeding.&nbsp; They soon distinguished
these sounds -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Isabella! what, ho! Isabella!&rdquo;&nbsp; The trembling Princess
relapsed into her former agony of fear.&nbsp; Theodore endeavoured to
encourage her, but in vain.&nbsp; He assured her he would die rather
than suffer her to return under Manfred&rsquo;s power; and begging her
to remain concealed, he went forth to prevent the person in search of
her from approaching.<br>
<br>
At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with
a peasant, who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the
rock.&nbsp; The Knight was preparing to seek her, when Theodore, placing
himself in his way, with his sword drawn, sternly forbad him at his
peril to advance.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And who art thou, who darest to cross my way?&rdquo; said the
Knight, haughtily.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;One who does not dare more than he will perform,&rdquo; said
Theodore.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I seek the Lady Isabella,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;and
understand she has taken refuge among these rocks.&nbsp; Impede me not,
or thou wilt repent having provoked my resentment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible,&rdquo;
said Theodore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Return whence thou camest, or we shall soon
know whose resentment is most terrible.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The stranger, who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the
Marquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as he was busied in getting
information of the Princess, and giving various orders to prevent her
falling into the power of the three Knights.&nbsp; Their chief had suspected
Manfred of being privy to the Princess&rsquo;s absconding, and this
insult from a man, who he concluded was stationed by that Prince to
secrete her, confirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but discharging
a blow with his sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed all obstruction,
if Theodore, who took him for one of Manfred&rsquo;s captains, and who
had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it, had
not received the stroke on his shield.&nbsp; The valour that had so
long been smothered in his breast broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously
on the Knight, whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives
to hardy deeds.&nbsp; The combat was furious, but not long.&nbsp; Theodore
wounded the Knight in three several places, and at last disarmed him
as he fainted by the loss of blood.<br>
<br>
The peasant, who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to
some of Manfred&rsquo;s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed
through the forest in pursuit of Isabella.&nbsp; They came up as the
Knight fell, whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger.&nbsp;
Theodore, notwithstanding his hatred to Manfred, could not behold the
victory he had gained without emotions of pity and generosity.&nbsp;
But he was more touched when he learned the quality of his adversary,
and was informed that he was no retainer, but an enemy, of Manfred.&nbsp;
He assisted the servants of the latter in disarming the Knight, and
in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed from his wounds.&nbsp;
The Knight recovering his speech, said, in a faint and faltering voice
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Generous foe, we have both been in an error.&nbsp; I took thee
for an instrument of the tyrant; I perceive thou hast made the like
mistake.&nbsp; It is too late for excuses.&nbsp; I faint.&nbsp; If Isabella
is at hand - call her - I have important secrets to - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He is dying!&rdquo; said one of the attendants; &ldquo;has nobody
a crucifix about them?&nbsp; Andrea, do thou pray over him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Fetch some water,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;and pour it down
his throat, while I hasten to the Princess.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Saying this, he flew to Isabella, and in few words told her modestly
that he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from
her father&rsquo;s court, who wished, ere he died, to impart something
of consequence to her.<br>
<br>
The Princess, who had been transported at hearing the voice of Theodore,
as he called to her to come forth, was astonished at what she heard.&nbsp;
Suffering herself to be conducted by Theodore, the new proof of whose
valour recalled her dispersed spirits, she came where the bleeding Knight
lay speechless on the ground.&nbsp; But her fears returned when she
beheld the domestics of Manfred.&nbsp; She would again have fled if
Theodore had not made her observe that they were unarmed, and had not
threatened them with instant death if they should dare to seize the
Princess.<br>
<br>
The stranger, opening his eyes, and beholding a woman, said, &ldquo;Art
thou - pray tell me truly - art thou Isabella of Vicenza?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;good heaven restore thee!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&ldquo;Then thou - then thou&rdquo; - said the Knight, struggling
for utterance - &ldquo;seest - thy father.&nbsp; Give me one - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! amazement! horror! what do I hear! what do I see!&rdquo;
cried Isabella.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father!&nbsp; You my father!&nbsp; How
came you here, Sir?&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, speak!&nbsp; Oh!
run for help, or he will expire!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis most true,&rdquo; said the wounded Knight, exerting
all his force; &ldquo;I am Frederic thy father.&nbsp; Yes, I came to
deliver thee.&nbsp; It will not be.&nbsp; Give me a parting kiss, and
take - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;do not exhaust yourself; suffer
us to convey you to the castle.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To the castle!&rdquo; said Isabella.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there no
help nearer than the castle?&nbsp; Would you expose my father to the
tyrant?&nbsp; If he goes thither, I dare not accompany him; and yet,
can I leave him!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Frederic, &ldquo;it matters not for me
whither I am carried.&nbsp; A few minutes will place me beyond danger;
but while I have eyes to dote on thee, forsake me not, dear Isabella!&nbsp;
This brave Knight - I know not who he is - will protect thy innocence.&nbsp;
Sir, you will not abandon my child, will you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Theodore, shedding tears over his victim, and vowing to guard the Princess
at the expense of his life, persuaded Frederic to suffer himself to
be conducted to the castle.&nbsp; They placed him on a horse belonging
to one of the domestics, after binding up his wounds as well as they
were able.&nbsp; Theodore marched by his side; and the afflicted Isabella,
who could not bear to quit him, followed mournfully behind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle, than they were
met by Hippolita and Matilda, whom Isabella had sent one of the domestics
before to advertise of their approach.&nbsp; The ladies causing Frederic
to be conveyed into the nearest chamber, retired, while the surgeons
examined his wounds.&nbsp; Matilda blushed at seeing Theodore and Isabella
together; but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter, and
condoling with her on her father&rsquo;s mischance.&nbsp; The surgeons
soon came to acquaint Hippolita that none of the Marquis&rsquo;s wounds
were dangerous; and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and
the Princesses.<br>
<br>
Theodore, under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his
apprehensions of the combat being fatal to Frederic, could not resist
the impulse of following Matilda.&nbsp; Her eyes were so often cast
down on meeting his, that Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively
as he gazed on Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had
told her in the cave engaged his affections.&nbsp; While this mute scene
passed, Hippolita demanded of Frederic the cause of his having taken
that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter; and threw in various
apologies to excuse her Lord for the match contracted between their
children.<br>
<br>
Frederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the
courtesy and benevolence of Hippolita: but he was still more struck
with the lovely form of Matilda.&nbsp; Wishing to detain them by his
bedside, he informed Hippolita of his story.&nbsp; He told her that,
while prisoner to the infidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of
whom he had learned no news since his captivity, was detained in a castle,
where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes: and that if
he obtained his liberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would
learn more.&nbsp; Alarmed at this dream, and incapable of obeying the
direction given by it, his chains became more grievous than ever.&nbsp;
But while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty,
he received the agreeable news that the confederate Princes who were
warring in Palestine had paid his ransom.&nbsp; He instantly set out
for the wood that had been marked in his dream.<br>
<br>
For three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without
seeing a human form: but on the evening of the third they came to a
cell, in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death.&nbsp;
Applying rich cordials, they brought the fainting man to his speech.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My sons,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am bounden to your charity
- but it is in vain - I am going to my eternal rest - yet I die with
the satisfaction of performing the will of heaven.&nbsp; When first
I repaired to this solitude, after seeing my country become a prey to
unbelievers - it is alas! above fifty years since I was witness to that
dreadful scene!&nbsp; St. Nicholas appeared to me, and revealed a secret,
which he bade me never disclose to mortal man, but on my death-bed.&nbsp;
This is that tremendous hour, and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors
to whom I was ordered to reveal my trust.&nbsp; As soon as ye have done
the last offices to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh tree
on the left hand of this poor cave, and your pains will - Oh! good heaven
receive my soul!&rdquo;&nbsp; With those words the devout man breathed
his last.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By break of day,&rdquo; continued Frederic, &ldquo;when we had
committed the holy relics to earth, we dug according to direction.&nbsp;
But what was our astonishment when about the depth of six feet we discovered
an enormous sabre - the very weapon yonder in the court.&nbsp; On the
blade, which was then partly out of the scabbard, though since closed
by our efforts in removing it, were written the following lines - no;
excuse me, Madam,&rdquo; added the Marquis, turning to Hippolita; &ldquo;if
I forbear to repeat them: I respect your sex and rank, and would not
be guilty of offending your ear with sounds injurious to aught that
is dear to you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He paused.&nbsp; Hippolita trembled.&nbsp; She did not doubt but Frederic
was destined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten
her house.&nbsp; Looking with anxious fondness at Matilda, a silent
tear stole down her cheek: but recollecting herself, she said -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Proceed, my Lord; heaven does nothing in vain; mortals must receive
its divine behests with lowliness and submission.&nbsp; It is our part
to deprecate its wrath, or bow to its decrees.&nbsp; Repeat the sentence,
my Lord; we listen resigned.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far.&nbsp; The dignity
and patient firmness of Hippolita penetrated him with respect, and the
tender silent affection with which the Princess and her daughter regarded
each other, melted him almost to tears.&nbsp; Yet apprehensive that
his forbearance to obey would be more alarming, he repeated in a faltering
and low voice the following lines:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er a casque that suits this sword is found,<br>
With perils is thy daughter compass&rsquo;d round;<br>
<i>Alfonso&rsquo;s</i> blood alone can save the maid,<br>
And quiet a long restless Prince&rsquo;s shade.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is there in these lines,&rdquo; said Theodore impatiently,
&ldquo;that affects these Princesses?&nbsp; Why were they to be shocked
by a mysterious delicacy, that has so little foundation?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your words are rude, young man,&rdquo; said the Marquis; &ldquo;and
though fortune has favoured you once - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My honoured Lord,&rdquo; said Isabella, who resented Theodore&rsquo;s
warmth, which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for Matilda,
&ldquo;discompose not yourself for the glosing of a peasant&rsquo;s
son: he forgets the reverence he owes you; but he is not accustomed
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
Hippolita, concerned at the heat that had arisen, checked Theodore for
his boldness, but with an air acknowledging his zeal; and changing the
conversation, demanded of Frederic where he had left her Lord?&nbsp;
As the Marquis was going to reply, they heard a noise without, and rising
to inquire the cause, Manfred, Jerome, and part of the troop, who had
met an imperfect rumour of what had happened, entered the chamber.&nbsp;
Manfred advanced hastily towards Frederic&rsquo;s bed to condole with
him on his misfortune, and to learn the circumstances of the combat,
when starting in an agony of terror and amazement, he cried -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ha! what art thou? thou dreadful spectre! is my hour come?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dearest, gracious Lord,&rdquo; cried Hippolita, clasping him
in her arms, &ldquo;what is it you see!&nbsp; Why do you fix your eye-balls
thus?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Manfred breathless; &ldquo;dost thou see nothing,
Hippolita?&nbsp; Is this ghastly phantom sent to me alone - to rue,
who did not - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sweetest self, my Lord,&rdquo; said Hippolita,
&ldquo;resume your soul, command your reason.&nbsp; There is none here,
but us, your friends.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What, is not that Alfonso?&rdquo; cried Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost
thou not see him? can it be my brain&rsquo;s delirium?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This! my Lord,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;this is Theodore,
the youth who has been so unfortunate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Theodore!&rdquo; said Manfred mournfully, and striking his forehead;
&ldquo;Theodore or a phantom, he has unhinged the soul of Manfred.&nbsp;
But how comes he here? and how comes he in armour?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I believe he went in search of Isabella,&rdquo; said Hippolita.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Of Isabella!&rdquo; said Manfred, relapsing into rage; &ldquo;yes,
yes, that is not doubtful -.&nbsp; But how did he escape from durance
in which I left him?&nbsp; Was it Isabella, or this hypocritical old
Friar, that procured his enlargement?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And would a parent be criminal, my Lord,&rdquo; said Theodore,
&ldquo;if he meditated the deliverance of his child?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome, amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son, and without
foundation, knew not what to think.&nbsp; He could not comprehend how
Theodore had escaped, how he came to be armed, and to encounter Frederic.&nbsp;
Still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to inflame
Manfred&rsquo;s wrath against his son.&nbsp; Jerome&rsquo;s silence
convinced Manfred that he had contrived Theodore&rsquo;s release.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And is it thus, thou ungrateful old man,&rdquo; said the Prince,
addressing himself to the Friar, &ldquo;that thou repayest mine and
Hippolita&rsquo;s bounties?&nbsp; And not content with traversing my
heart&rsquo;s nearest wishes, thou armest thy bastard, and bringest
him into my own castle to insult me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;you wrong my father: neither
he nor I are capable of harbouring a thought against your peace.&nbsp;
Is it insolence thus to surrender myself to your Highness&rsquo;s pleasure?&rdquo;
added he, laying his sword respectfully at Manfred&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold my bosom; strike, my Lord, if you suspect that a disloyal
thought is lodged there.&nbsp; There is not a sentiment engraven on
my heart that does not venerate you and yours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these words interested
every person present in his favour.&nbsp; Even Manfred was touched -
yet still possessed with his resemblance to Alfonso, his admiration
was dashed with secret horror.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Rise,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;thy life is not my present purpose.&nbsp;
But tell me thy history, and how thou camest connected with this old
traitor here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Jerome eagerly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Peace! impostor!&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;I will not have
him prompted.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;I want no assistance; my
story is very brief.&nbsp; I was carried at five years of age to Algiers
with my mother, who had been taken by corsairs from the coast of Sicily.&nbsp;
She died of grief in less than a twelvemonth;&rdquo; the tears gushed
from Jerome&rsquo;s eyes, on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions
stood expressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before she died,&rdquo; continued Theodore,
&ldquo;she bound a writing about my arm under my garments, which told
me I was the son of the Count Falconara.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is most true,&rdquo; said Jerome; &ldquo;I am that wretched
father.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Again I enjoin thee silence,&rdquo; said Manfred: &ldquo;proceed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I remained in slavery,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;until within
these two years, when attending on my master in his cruises, I was delivered
by a Christian vessel, which overpowered the pirate; and discovering
myself to the captain, he generously put me on shore in Sicily; but
alas! instead of finding a father, I learned that his estate, which
was situated on the coast, had, during his absence, been laid waste
by the Rover who had carried my mother and me into captivity: that his
castle had been burnt to the ground, and that my father on his return
had sold what remained, and was retired into religion in the kingdom
of Naples, but where no man could inform me.&nbsp; Destitute and friendless,
hopeless almost of attaining the transport of a parent&rsquo;s embrace,
I took the first opportunity of setting sail for Naples, from whence,
within these six days, I wandered into this province, still supporting
myself by the labour of my hands; nor until yester-morn did I believe
that heaven had reserved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented
poverty.&nbsp; This, my Lord, is Theodore&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; I am
blessed beyond my hope in finding a father; I am unfortunate beyond
my desert in having incurred your Highness&rsquo;s displeasure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He ceased.&nbsp; A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is not all,&rdquo; said Frederic; &ldquo;I am bound in honour
to add what he suppresses.&nbsp; Though he is modest, I must be generous;
he is one of the bravest youths on Christian ground.&nbsp; He is warm
too; and from the short knowledge I have of him, I will pledge myself
for his veracity: if what he reports of himself were not true, he would
not utter it - and for me, youth, I honour a frankness which becomes
thy birth; but now, and thou didst offend me: yet the noble blood which
flows in thy veins, may well be allowed to boil out, when it has so
recently traced itself to its source.&nbsp; Come, my Lord,&rdquo; (turning
to Manfred), &ldquo;if I can pardon him, surely you may; it is not the
youth&rsquo;s fault, if you took him for a spectre.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This bitter taunt galled the soul of Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If beings from another world,&rdquo; replied he haughtily, &ldquo;have
power to impress my mind with awe, it is more than living man can do;
nor could a stripling&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; interrupted Hippolita, &ldquo;your guest has
occasion for repose: shall we not leave him to his rest?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Saying this, and taking Manfred by the hand, she took leave of Frederic,
and led the company forth.<br>
<br>
The Prince, not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind
the discovery he had made of his most secret sensations, suffered himself
to be conducted to his own apartment, after permitting Theodore, though
under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow (a condition
the young man gladly accepted), to retire with his father to the convent.&nbsp;
Matilda and Isabella were too much occupied with their own reflections,
and too little content with each other, to wish for farther converse
that night.&nbsp; They separated each to her chamber, with more expressions
of ceremony and fewer of affection thou had passed between them since
their childhood.<br>
<br>
If they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater
impatience, as soon as the sun was risen.&nbsp; Their minds were in
a situation that excluded sleep, and each recollected a thousand questions
which she wished she had put to the other overnight.&nbsp; Matilda reflected
that Isabella had been twice delivered by Theodore in very critical
situations, which she could not believe accidental.&nbsp; His eyes,
it was true, had been fixed on her in Frederic&rsquo;s chamber; but
that might have been to disguise his passion for Isabella from the fathers
of both.&nbsp; It were better to clear this up.&nbsp; She wished to
know the truth, lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion
for Isabella&rsquo;s lover.&nbsp; Thus jealousy prompted, and at the
same time borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity.<br>
<br>
Isabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her suspicions.&nbsp;
Both Theodore&rsquo;s tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged;
it was true - yet, perhaps, Matilda might not correspond to his passion;
she had ever appeared insensible to love: all her thoughts were set
on heaven.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why did I dissuade her?&rdquo; said Isabella to herself; &ldquo;I
am punished for my generosity; but when did they meet? where?&nbsp;
It cannot be; I have deceived myself; perhaps last night was the first
time they ever beheld each other; it must be some other object that
has prepossessed his affections - if it is, I am not so unhappy as I
thought; if it is not my friend Matilda - how!&nbsp; Can I stoop to
wish for the affection of a man, who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted
me with his indifference? and that at the very moment in which common
courtesy demanded at least expressions of civility.&nbsp; I will go
to my dear Matilda, who will confirm me in this becoming pride.&nbsp;
Man is false - I will advise with her on taking the veil: she will rejoice
to find me in this disposition; and I will acquaint her that I no longer
oppose her inclination for the cloister.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In this frame of mind, and determined to open her heart entirely to
Matilda, she went to that Princess&rsquo;s chamber, whom she found already
dressed, and leaning pensively on her arm.&nbsp; This attitude, so correspondent
to what she felt herself, revived Isabella&rsquo;s suspicions, and destroyed
the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.&nbsp; They blushed
at meeting, and were too much novices to disguise their sensations with
address.&nbsp; After some unmeaning questions and replies, Matilda demanded
of Isabella the cause of her flight?&nbsp; The latter, who had almost
forgotten Manfred&rsquo;s passion, so entirely was she occupied by her
own, concluding that Matilda referred to her last escape from the convent,
which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening, replied -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Matilda, interrupting her, &ldquo;Bianca has
explained that mistake to me: on seeing me faint, she cried out, &lsquo;The
Princess is dead!&rsquo; and Martelli, who had come for the usual dole
to the castle - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And what made you faint?&rdquo; said Isabella, indifferent to
the rest.&nbsp; Matilda blushed and stammered -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My father - he was sitting in judgment on a criminal - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What criminal?&rdquo; said Isabella eagerly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A young man,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;I believe - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think it was that young man that - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What, Theodore?&rdquo; said Isabella.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;I never saw him before; I do
not know how he had offended my father, but as he has been of service
to you, I am glad my Lord has pardoned him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Served me!&rdquo; replied Isabella; &ldquo;do you term it serving
me, to wound my father, and almost occasion his death?&nbsp; Though
it is but since yesterday that I am blessed with knowing a parent, I
hope Matilda does not think I am such a stranger to filial tenderness
as not to resent the boldness of that audacious youth, and that it is
impossible for me ever to feel any affection for one who dared to lift
his arm against the author of my being.&nbsp; No, Matilda, my heart
abhors him; and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have
vowed from your infancy, you will detest a man who has been on the point
of making me miserable for ever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Matilda held down her head and replied: &ldquo;I hope my dearest Isabella
does not doubt her Matilda&rsquo;s friendship: I never beheld that youth
until yesterday; he is almost a stranger to me: but as the surgeons
have pronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour
uncharitable resentment against one, who I am persuaded did not know
the Marquis was related to you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You plead his cause very pathetically,&rdquo; said Isabella,
&ldquo;considering he is so much a stranger to you!&nbsp; I am mistaken,
or he returns your charity.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What mean you?&rdquo; said Matilda.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Isabella, repenting that she had given Matilda
a hint of Theodore&rsquo;s inclination for her.&nbsp; Then changing
the discourse, she asked Matilda what occasioned Manfred to take Theodore
for a spectre?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;did not you observe his
extreme resemblance to the portrait of Alfonso in the gallery?&nbsp;
I took notice of it to Bianca even before I saw him in armour; but with
the helmet on, he is the very image of that picture.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do not much observe pictures,&rdquo; said Isabella: &ldquo;much
less have I examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have
done.&nbsp; Ah?&nbsp; Matilda, your heart is in danger, but let me warn
you as a friend, he has owned to me that he is in love; it cannot be
with you, for yesterday was the first time you ever met - was it not?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Matilda; &ldquo;but why does my dearest
Isabella conclude from anything I have said, that&rdquo; - she paused
- then continuing: &ldquo;he saw you first, and I am far from having
the vanity to think that my little portion of charms could engage a
heart devoted to you; may you be happy, Isabella, whatever is the fate
of Matilda!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My lovely friend,&rdquo; said Isabella, whose heart was too honest
to resist a kind expression, &ldquo;it is you that Theodore admires;
I saw it; I am persuaded of it; nor shall a thought of my own happiness
suffer me to interfere with yours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This frankness drew tears from the gentle Matilda; and jealousy that
for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon
gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls.&nbsp;
Each confessed to the other the impression that Theodore had made on
her; and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity, each
insisting on yielding her claim to her friend.&nbsp; At length the dignity
of Isabella&rsquo;s virtue reminding her of the preference which Theodore
had almost declared for her rival, made her determine to conquer her
passion, and cede the beloved object to her friend.<br>
<br>
During this contest of amity, Hippolita entered her daughter&rsquo;s
chamber.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said she to Isabella, &ldquo;you have so much tenderness
for Matilda, and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our
wretched house, that I can have no secrets with my child which are not
proper for you to hear.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The princesses were all attention and anxiety.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Know then, Madam,&rdquo; continued Hippolita, &ldquo;and you
my dearest Matilda, that being convinced by all the events of these
two last ominous days, that heaven purposes the sceptre of Otranto should
pass from Manfred&rsquo;s hands into those of the Marquis Frederic,
I have been perhaps inspired with the thought of averting our total
destruction by the union of our rival houses.&nbsp; With this view I
have been proposing to Manfred, my lord, to tender this dear, dear child
to Frederic, your father.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Me to Lord Frederic!&rdquo; cried Matilda; &ldquo;good heavens!
my gracious mother - and have you named it to my father?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;he listened benignly to
my proposal, and is gone to break it to the Marquis.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah! wretched princess!&rdquo; cried Isabella; &ldquo;what hast
thou done! what ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for
thyself, for me, and for Matilda!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ruin from me to you and to my child!&rdquo; said Hippolita &ldquo;what
can this mean?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Isabella, &ldquo;the purity of your own heart
prevents your seeing the depravity of others.&nbsp; Manfred, your lord,
that impious man - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;you must not in my presence,
young lady, mention Manfred with disrespect: he is my lord and husband,
and - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Will not long be so,&rdquo; said Isabella, &ldquo;if his wicked
purposes can be carried into execution.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This language amazes me,&rdquo; said Hippolita.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
feeling, Isabella, is warm; but until this hour I never knew it betray
you into intemperance.&nbsp; What deed of Manfred authorises you to
treat him as a murderer, an assassin?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou virtuous, and too credulous Princess!&rdquo; replied Isabella;
&ldquo;it is not thy life he aims at - it is to separate himself from
thee! to divorce thee! to - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To divorce me!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To divorce my mother!&rdquo;
cried Hippolita and Matilda at once.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Isabella; &ldquo;and to complete his crime,
he meditates - I cannot speak it!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What can surpass what thou hast already uttered?&rdquo; said
Matilda.<br>
<br>
Hippolita was silent.&nbsp; Grief choked her speech; and the recollection
of Manfred&rsquo;s late ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Excellent, dear lady! madam! mother!&rdquo; cried Isabella, flinging
herself at Hippolita&rsquo;s feet in a transport of passion; &ldquo;trust
me, believe me, I will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to
injure you, than yield to so odious - oh! - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is too much!&rdquo; cried Hippolita: &ldquo;What crimes
does one crime suggest!&nbsp; Rise, dear Isabella; I do not doubt your
virtue.&nbsp; Oh! Matilda, this stroke is too heavy for thee! weep not,
my child; and not a murmur, I charge thee.&nbsp; Remember, he is thy
father still!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But you are my mother too,&rdquo; said Matilda fervently; &ldquo;and
you are virtuous, you are guiltless! - Oh! must not I, must not I complain?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; said Hippolita - &ldquo;come, all will yet
be well.&nbsp; Manfred, in the agony for the loss of thy brother, knew
not what he said; perhaps Isabella misunderstood him; his heart is good
- and, my child, thou knowest not all!&nbsp; There is a destiny hangs
over us; the hand of Providence is stretched out; oh! could I but save
thee from the wreck!&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; continued she in a firmer tone,
&ldquo;perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for all; I will go
and offer myself to this divorce - it boots not what becomes of me.&nbsp;
I will withdraw into the neighbouring monastery, and waste the remainder
of life in prayers and tears for my child and - the Prince!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art as much too good for this world,&rdquo; said Isabella,
&ldquo;as Manfred is execrable; but think not, lady, that thy weakness
shall determine for me.&nbsp; I swear, hear me all ye angels - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stop, I adjure thee,&rdquo; cried Hippolita: &ldquo;remember
thou dost not depend on thyself; thou hast a father.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My father is too pious, too noble,&rdquo; interrupted Isabella,
&ldquo;to command an impious deed.&nbsp; But should he command it; can
a father enjoin a cursed act?&nbsp; I was contracted to the son, can
I wed the father?&nbsp; No, madam, no; force should not drag me to Manfred&rsquo;s
hated bed.&nbsp; I loathe him, I abhor him: divine and human laws forbid
- and my friend, my dearest Matilda! would I wound her tender soul by
injuring her adored mother? my own mother - I never have known another&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! she is the mother of both!&rdquo; cried Matilda: &ldquo;can
we, can we, Isabella, adore her too much?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My lovely children,&rdquo; said the touched Hippolita, &ldquo;your
tenderness overpowers me - but I must not give way to it.&nbsp; It is
not ours to make election for ourselves: heaven, our fathers, and our
husbands must decide for us.&nbsp; Have patience until you hear what
Manfred and Frederic have determined.&nbsp; If the Marquis accepts Matilda&rsquo;s
hand, I know she will readily obey.&nbsp; Heaven may interpose and prevent
the rest.&nbsp; What means my child?&rdquo; continued she, seeing Matilda
fall at her feet with a flood of speechless tears - &ldquo;But no; answer
me not, my daughter: I must not hear a word against the pleasure of
thy father.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! doubt not my obedience, my dreadful obedience to him and
to you!&rdquo; said Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;But can I, most respected
of women, can I experience all this tenderness, this world of goodness,
and conceal a thought from the best of mothers?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What art thou going to utter?&rdquo; said Isabella trembling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Recollect thyself, Matilda.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, Isabella,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;I should not deserve
this incomparable parent, if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured
a thought without her permission - nay, I have offended her; I have
suffered a passion to enter my heart without her avowal - but here I
disclaim it; here I vow to heaven and her - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My child! my child;&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;what words
are these! what new calamities has fate in store for us!&nbsp; Thou,
a passion?&nbsp; Thou, in this hour of destruction - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! I see all my guilt!&rdquo; said Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;I abhor
myself, if I cost my mother a pang.&nbsp; She is the dearest thing I
have on earth - Oh! I will never, never behold him more!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Isabella,&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;thou art conscious to
this unhappy secret, whatever it is.&nbsp; Speak!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Matilda, &ldquo;have I so forfeited my mother&rsquo;s
love, that she will not permit me even to speak my own guilt? oh! wretched,
wretched Matilda!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art too cruel,&rdquo; said Isabella to Hippolita: &ldquo;canst
thou behold this anguish of a virtuous mind, and not commiserate it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not pity my child!&rdquo; said Hippolita, catching Matilda in
her arms - &ldquo;Oh! I know she is good, she is all virtue, all tenderness,
and duty.&nbsp; I do forgive thee, my excellent, my only hope!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The princesses then revealed to Hippolita their mutual inclination for
Theodore, and the purpose of Isabella to resign him to Matilda.&nbsp;
Hippolita blamed their imprudence, and showed them the improbability
that either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a
man, though nobly born.&nbsp; Some comfort it gave her to find their
passion of so recent a date, and that Theodore had had but little cause
to suspect it in either.&nbsp; She strictly enjoined them to avoid all
correspondence with him.&nbsp; This Matilda fervently promised: but
Isabella, who flattered herself that she meant no more than to promote
his union with her friend, could not determine to avoid him; and made
no reply.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will go to the convent,&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;and order
new masses to be said for a deliverance from these calamities.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! my mother,&rdquo; said Matilda, &ldquo;you mean to quit us:
you mean to take sanctuary, and to give my father an opportunity of
pursuing his fatal intention.&nbsp; Alas! on my knees I supplicate you
to forbear; will you leave me a prey to Frederic?&nbsp; I will follow
you to the convent.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Be at peace, my child,&rdquo; said Hippolita: &ldquo;I will return
instantly.&nbsp; I will never abandon thee, until I know it is the will
of heaven, and for thy benefit.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do not deceive me,&rdquo; said Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not
marry Frederic until thou commandest it.&nbsp; Alas! what will become
of me?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why that exclamation?&rdquo; said Hippolita.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
promised thee to return - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah! my mother,&rdquo; replied Matilda, &ldquo;stay and save me
from myself.&nbsp; A frown from thee can do more than all my father&rsquo;s
severity.&nbsp; I have given away my heart, and you alone can make me
recall it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;thou must not relapse,
Matilda.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can quit Theodore,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but must I wed another?
let me attend thee to the altar, and shut myself from the world for
ever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thy fate depends on thy father,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;I
have ill-bestowed my tenderness, if it has taught thee to revere aught
beyond him.&nbsp; Adieu! my child: I go to pray for thee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Hippolita&rsquo;s real purpose was to demand of Jerome, whether in conscience
she might not consent to the divorce.&nbsp; She had oft urged Manfred
to resign the principality, which the delicacy of her conscience rendered
an hourly burthen to her.&nbsp; These scruples concurred to make the
separation from her husband appear less dreadful to her than it would
have seemed in any other situation.<br>
<br>
Jerome, at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned Theodore severely
why he had accused him to Manfred of being privy to his escape.&nbsp;
Theodore owned it had been with design to prevent Manfred&rsquo;s suspicion
from alighting on Matilda; and added, the holiness of Jerome&rsquo;s
life and character secured him from the tyrant&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp;
Jerome was heartily grieved to discover his son&rsquo;s inclination
for that princess; and leaving him to his rest, promised in the morning
to acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion.<br>
<br>
Theodore, like Isabella, was too recently acquainted with parental authority
to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart.&nbsp; He
had little curiosity to learn the Friar&rsquo;s reasons, and less disposition
to obey them.&nbsp; The lovely Matilda had made stronger impressions
on him than filial affection.&nbsp; All night he pleased himself with
visions of love; and it was not till late after the morning-office,
that he recollected the Friar&rsquo;s commands to attend him at Alfonso&rsquo;s
tomb.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Jerome, when he saw him, &ldquo;this tardiness
does not please me.&nbsp; Have a father&rsquo;s commands already so
little weight?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Theodore made awkward excuses, and attributed his delay to having overslept
himself.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And on whom were thy dreams employed?&rdquo; said the Friar sternly.&nbsp;
His son blushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; resumed the Friar,
&ldquo;inconsiderate youth, this must not be; eradicate this guilty
passion from thy breast - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Guilty passion!&rdquo; cried Theodore: &ldquo;Can guilt dwell
with innocent beauty and virtuous modesty?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is sinful,&rdquo; replied the Friar, &ldquo;to cherish those
whom heaven has doomed to destruction.&nbsp; A tyrant&rsquo;s race must
be swept from the earth to the third and fourth generation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty?&rdquo;
said Theodore.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fair Matilda has virtues enough - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To undo thee:&rdquo; interrupted Jerome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hast thou
so soon forgotten that twice the savage Manfred has pronounced thy sentence?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nor have I forgotten, sir,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;that
the charity of his daughter delivered me from his power.&nbsp; I can
forget injuries, but never benefits.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The injuries thou hast received from Manfred&rsquo;s race,&rdquo;
said the Friar, &ldquo;are beyond what thou canst conceive.&nbsp; Reply
not, but view this holy image!&nbsp; Beneath this marble monument rest
the ashes of the good Alfonso; a prince adorned with every virtue: the
father of his people! the delight of mankind!&nbsp; Kneel, headstrong
boy, and list, while a father unfolds a tale of horror that will expel
every sentiment from thy soul, but sensations of sacred vengeance -
Alfonso! much injured prince! let thy unsatisfied shade sit awful on
the troubled air, while these trembling lips - Ha! who comes there?
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The most wretched of women!&rdquo; said Hippolita, entering the
choir.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good Father, art thou at leisure? - but why this
kneeling youth? what means the horror imprinted on each countenance?
why at this venerable tomb - alas! hast thou seen aught?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We were pouring forth our orisons to heaven,&rdquo; replied the
Friar, with some confusion, &ldquo;to put an end to the woes of this
deplorable province.&nbsp; Join with us, Lady! thy spotless soul may
obtain an exemption from the judgments which the portents of these days
but too speakingly denounce against thy house.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I pray fervently to heaven to divert them,&rdquo; said the pious
Princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou knowest it has been the occupation of my
life to wrest a blessing for my Lord and my harmless children. - One
alas! is taken from me! would heaven but hear me for my poor Matilda!&nbsp;
Father! intercede for her!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Every heart will bless her,&rdquo; cried Theodore with rapture.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Be dumb, rash youth!&rdquo; said Jerome.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thou,
fond Princess, contend not with the Powers above! the Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away: bless His holy name, and submit to his decrees.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do most devoutly,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;but will He
not spare my only comfort? must Matilda perish too? - ah!&nbsp; Father,
I came - but dismiss thy son.&nbsp; No ear but thine must hear what
I have to utter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;May heaven grant thy every wish, most excellent Princess!&rdquo;
said Theodore retiring.&nbsp; Jerome frowned.<br>
<br>
Hippolita then acquainted the Friar with the proposal she had suggested
to Manfred, his approbation of it, and the tender of Matilda that he
was gone to make to Frederic.&nbsp; Jerome could not conceal his dislike
of the notion, which he covered under pretence of the improbability
that Frederic, the nearest of blood to Alfonso, and who was come to
claim his succession, would yield to an alliance with the usurper of
his right.&nbsp; But nothing could equal the perplexity of the Friar,
when Hippolita confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation,
and demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence.&nbsp;
The Friar caught eagerly at her request of his advice, and without explaining
his aversion to the proposed marriage of Manfred and Isabella, he painted
to Hippolita in the most alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent,
denounced judgments against her if she complied, and enjoined her in
the severest terms to treat any such proposition with every mark of
indignation and refusal.<br>
<br>
Manfred, in the meantime, had broken his purpose to Frederic, and proposed
the double marriage.&nbsp; That weak Prince, who had been struck with
the charms of Matilda, listened but too eagerly to the offer.&nbsp;
He forgot his enmity to Manfred, whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing
by force; and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the
union of his daughter with the tyrant, he looked upon his own succession
to the principality as facilitated by wedding Matilda.&nbsp; He made
faint opposition to the proposal; affecting, for form only, not to acquiesce
unless Hippolita should consent to the divorce.&nbsp; Manfred took that
upon himself.<br>
<br>
Transported with his success, and impatient to see himself in a situation
to expect sons, he hastened to his wife&rsquo;s apartment, determined
to extort her compliance.&nbsp; He learned with indignation that she
was absent at the convent.&nbsp; His guilt suggested to him that she
had probably been informed by Isabella of his purpose.&nbsp; He doubted
whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention of
remaining there, until she could raise obstacles to their divorce; and
the suspicions he had already entertained of Jerome, made him apprehend
that the Friar would not only traverse his views, but might have inspired
Hippolita with the resolution of talking sanctuary.&nbsp; Impatient
to unravel this clue, and to defeat its success, Manfred hastened to
the convent, and arrived there as the Friar was earnestly exhorting
the Princess never to yield to the divorce.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;what business drew you hither?
why did you not await my return from the Marquis?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I came to implore a blessing on your councils,&rdquo; replied
Hippolita.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My councils do not need a Friar&rsquo;s intervention,&rdquo;
said Manfred; &ldquo;and of all men living is that hoary traitor the
only one whom you delight to confer with?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Profane Prince!&rdquo; said Jerome; &ldquo;is it at the altar
that thou choosest to insult the servants of the altar? - but, Manfred,
thy impious schemes are known.&nbsp; Heaven and this virtuous lady know
them - nay, frown not, Prince.&nbsp; The Church despises thy menaces.&nbsp;
Her thunders will be heard above thy wrath.&nbsp; Dare to proceed in
thy cursed purpose of a divorce, until her sentence be known, and here
I lance her anathema at thy head.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Audacious rebel!&rdquo; said Manfred, endeavouring to conceal
the awe with which the Friar&rsquo;s words inspired him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost
thou presume to threaten thy lawful Prince?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art no lawful Prince,&rdquo; said Jerome; &ldquo;thou art
no Prince - go, discuss thy claim with Frederic; and when that is done
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; replied Manfred; &ldquo;Frederic accepts Matilda&rsquo;s
hand, and is content to waive his claim, unless I have no male issue&rdquo;
- as he spoke those words three drops of blood fell from the nose of
Alfonso&rsquo;s statue.&nbsp; Manfred turned pale, and the Princess
sank on her knees.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;mark this miraculous indication
that the blood of Alfonso will never mix with that of Manfred!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My gracious Lord,&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;let us submit
ourselves to heaven.&nbsp; Think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against
thy authority.&nbsp; I have no will but that of my Lord and the Church.&nbsp;
To that revered tribunal let us appeal.&nbsp; It does not depend on
us to burst the bonds that unite us.&nbsp; If the Church shall approve
the dissolution of our marriage, be it so - I have but few years, and
those of sorrow, to pass.&nbsp; Where can they be worn away so well
as at the foot of this altar, in prayers for thine and Matilda&rsquo;s
safety?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But thou shalt not remain here until then,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Repair with me to the castle, and there I will advise on the
proper measures for a divorce; - but this meddling Friar comes not thither;
my hospitable roof shall never more harbour a traitor - and for thy
Reverence&rsquo;s offspring,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I banish him
from my dominions.&nbsp; He, I ween, is no sacred personage, nor under
the protection of the Church.&nbsp; Whoever weds Isabella, it shall
not be Father Falconara&rsquo;s started-up son.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They start up,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;who are suddenly
beheld in the seat of lawful Princes; but they wither away like the
grass, and their place knows them no more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, casting a look of scorn at the Friar, led Hippolita forth;
but at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants to remain
concealed about the convent, and bring him instant notice, if any one
from the castle should repair thither.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Every reflection which Manfred made on the Friar&rsquo;s behaviour,
conspired to persuade him that Jerome was privy to an amour between
Isabella and Theodore.&nbsp; But Jerome&rsquo;s new presumption, so
dissonant from his former meekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions.&nbsp;
The Prince even suspected that the Friar depended on some secret support
from Frederic, whose arrival, coinciding with the novel appearance of
Theodore, seemed to bespeak a correspondence.&nbsp; Still more was he
troubled with the resemblance of Theodore to Alfonso&rsquo;s portrait.&nbsp;
The latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue.&nbsp; Frederic
had consented to bestow Isabella on him.&nbsp; These contradictions
agitated his mind with numberless pangs.<br>
<br>
He saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties.&nbsp;
The one was to resign his dominions to the Marquis - pride, ambition,
and his reliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a possibility
of his preserving them to his posterity, combated that thought.&nbsp;
The other was to press his marriage with Isabella.&nbsp; After long
ruminating on these anxious thoughts, as he marched silently with Hippolita
to the castle, he at last discoursed with that Princess on the subject
of his disquiet, and used every insinuating and plausible argument to
extract her consent to, even her promise of promoting the divorce.&nbsp;
Hippolita needed little persuasions to bend her to his pleasure.&nbsp;
She endeavoured to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions;
but finding her exhortations fruitless, she assured him, that as far
as her conscience would allow, she would raise no opposition to a separation,
though without better founded scruples than what he yet alleged, she
would not engage to be active in demanding it.<br>
<br>
This compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred&rsquo;s
hopes.&nbsp; He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance
his suit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved to engage Frederic
to take a journey on purpose.&nbsp; That Prince had discovered so much
passion for Matilda, that Manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding
out or withdrawing his daughter&rsquo;s charms, according as the Marquis
should appear more or less disposed to co-operate in his views.&nbsp;
Even the absence of Frederic would be a material point gained, until
he could take further measures for his security.<br>
<br>
Dismissing Hippolita to her apartment, he repaired to that of the Marquis;
but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met Bianca.&nbsp;
The damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young ladies.&nbsp;
It immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject of Isabella
and Theodore.&nbsp; Calling her aside into the recess of the oriel window
of the hall, and soothing her with many fair words and promises, he
demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of Isabella&rsquo;s
affections.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I! my Lord! no my Lord - yes my Lord - poor Lady! she is wonderfully
alarmed about her father&rsquo;s wounds; but I tell her he will do well;
don&rsquo;t your Highness think so?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do not ask you,&rdquo; replied Manfred, &ldquo;what she thinks
about her father; but you are in her secrets.&nbsp; Come, be a good
girl and tell me; is there any young man - ha! - you understand me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lord bless me! understand your Highness? no, not I.&nbsp; I told
her a few vulnerary herbs and repose - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am not talking,&rdquo; replied the Prince, impatiently, &ldquo;about
her father; I know he will do well.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bless me, I rejoice to hear your Highness say so; for though
I thought it not right to let my young Lady despond, methought his greatness
had a wan look, and a something - I remember when young Ferdinand was
wounded by the Venetian - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&ldquo;Thou answerest from the point,&rdquo; interrupted Manfred;
&ldquo;but here, take this jewel, perhaps that may fix thy attention
- nay, no reverences; my favour shall not stop here - come, tell me
truly; how stands Isabella&rsquo;s heart?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well! your Highness has such a way!&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;to
be sure - but can your Highness keep a secret? if it should ever come
out of your lips - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It shall not, it shall not,&rdquo; cried Manfred.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay, but swear, your Highness.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By my halidame, if it should ever be known that I said it - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, truth is truth, I do not think my Lady Isabella ever much
affectioned my young Lord your son; yet he was a sweet youth as one
should see; I am sure, if I had been a Princess - but bless me!&nbsp;
I must attend my Lady Matilda; she will marvel what is become of me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; cried Manfred; &ldquo;thou hast not satisfied my
question.&nbsp; Hast thou ever carried any message, any letter?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I! good gracious!&rdquo; cried Bianca; &ldquo;I carry a letter?&nbsp;
I would not to be a Queen.&nbsp; I hope your Highness thinks, though
I am poor, I am honest.&nbsp; Did your Highness never hear what Count
Marsigli offered me, when he came a wooing to my Lady Matilda?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have not leisure,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;to listen to
thy tale.&nbsp; I do not question thy honesty.&nbsp; But it is thy duty
to conceal nothing from me.&nbsp; How long has Isabella been acquainted
with Theodore?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay, there is nothing can escape your Highness!&rdquo; said Bianca;
&ldquo;not that I know any thing of the matter.&nbsp; Theodore, to be
sure, is a proper young man, and, as my Lady Matilda says, the very
image of good Alfonso.&nbsp; Has not your Highness remarked it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, - No - thou torturest me,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where did they meet? when?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who! my Lady Matilda?&rdquo; said Bianca.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no, not Matilda: Isabella; when did Isabella first become
acquainted with this Theodore!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Virgin Mary!&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;how should I know?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou dost know,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;and I must know;
I will - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lord! your Highness is not jealous of young Theodore!&rdquo;
said Bianca.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jealous! no, no.&nbsp; Why should I be jealous? perhaps I mean
to unite them - If I were sure Isabella would have no repugnance.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Repugnance! no, I&rsquo;ll warrant her,&rdquo; said Bianca; &ldquo;he
is as comely a youth as ever trod on Christian ground.&nbsp; We are
all in love with him; there is not a soul in the castle but would be
rejoiced to have him for our Prince - I mean, when it shall please heaven
to call your Highness to itself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;has it gone so far! oh! this
cursed Friar! - but I must not lose time - go, Bianca, attend Isabella;
but I charge thee, not a word of what has passed.&nbsp; Find out how
she is affected towards Theodore; bring me good news, and that ring
has a companion.&nbsp; Wait at the foot of the winding staircase: I
am going to visit the Marquis, and will talk further with thee at my
return.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, after some general conversation, desired Frederic to dismiss
the two Knights, his companions, having to talk with him on urgent affairs.<br>
<br>
As soon as they were alone, he began in artful guise to sound the Marquis
on the subject of Matilda; and finding him disposed to his wish, he
let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration
of their marriage, unless - At that instant Bianca burst into the room
with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! my Lord, my Lord!&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;we are all undone!
it is come again! it is come again!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is come again?&rdquo; cried Manfred amazed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! the hand! the Giant! the hand! - support me! I am terrified
out of my senses,&rdquo; cried Bianca.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not sleep
in the castle to-night.&nbsp; Where shall I go? my things may come after
me to-morrow - would I had been content to wed Francesco! this comes
of ambition!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What has terrified thee thus, young woman?&rdquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou art safe here; be not alarmed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! your Greatness is wonderfully good,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;but
I dare not - no, pray let me go - I had rather leave everything behind
me, than stay another hour under this roof.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Go to, thou hast lost thy senses,&rdquo; said Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Interrupt us not; we were communing on important matters - My
Lord, this wench is subject to fits - Come with me, Bianca.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! the Saints!&nbsp; No,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;for certain
it comes to warn your Highness; why should it appear to me else?&nbsp;
I say my prayers morning and evening - oh! if your Highness had believed
Diego!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the same hand that he saw the foot to in the
gallery-chamber - Father Jerome has often told us the prophecy would
be out one of these days - &lsquo;Bianca,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;mark
my words - &rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou ravest,&rdquo; said Manfred, in a rage; &ldquo;be gone,
and keep these fooleries to frighten thy companions.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What! my Lord,&rdquo; cried Bianca, &ldquo;do you think I have
seen nothing? go to the foot of the great stairs yourself - as I live
I saw it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Saw what? tell us, fair maid, what thou hast seen,&rdquo; said
Frederic.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Can your Highness listen,&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;to the
delirium of a silly wench, who has heard stories of apparitions until
she believes them?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is more than fancy,&rdquo; said the Marquis; &ldquo;her
terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination.&nbsp;
Tell us, fair maiden, what it is has moved thee thus?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord, thank your Greatness,&rdquo; said Bianca; &ldquo;I
believe I look very pale; I shall be better when I have recovered myself
- I was going to my Lady Isabella&rsquo;s chamber, by his Highness&rsquo;s
order - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We do not want the circumstances,&rdquo; interrupted Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Since his Highness will have it so, proceed; but be brief.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lord! your Highness thwarts one so!&rdquo; replied Bianca; &ldquo;I
fear my hair - I am sure I never in my life - well! as I was telling
your Greatness, I was going by his Highness&rsquo;s order to my Lady
Isabella&rsquo;s chamber; she lies in the watchet-coloured chamber,
on the right hand, one pair of stairs: so when I came to the great stairs
- I was looking on his Highness&rsquo;s present here - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Grant me patience!&rdquo; said Manfred, &ldquo;will this wench
never come to the point? what imports it to the Marquis, that I gave
thee a bauble for thy faithful attendance on my daughter? we want to
know what thou sawest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I was going to tell your Highness,&rdquo; said Bianca, &ldquo;if
you would permit me.&nbsp; So as I was rubbing the ring - I am sure
I had not gone up three steps, but I heard the rattling of armour; for
all the world such a clatter as Diego says he heard when the Giant turned
him about in the gallery-chamber.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What Giant is this, my Lord?&rdquo; said the Marquis; &ldquo;is
your castle haunted by giants and goblins?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lord! what, has not your Greatness heard the story of the Giant
in the gallery-chamber?&rdquo; cried Bianca.&nbsp; &ldquo;I marvel his
Highness has not told you; mayhap you do not know there is a prophecy
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This trifling is intolerable,&rdquo; interrupted Manfred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us dismiss this silly wench, my Lord! we have more important
affairs to discuss.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By your favour,&rdquo; said Frederic, &ldquo;these are no trifles.&nbsp;
The enormous sabre I was directed to in the wood, yon casque, its fellow
- are these visions of this poor maiden&rsquo;s brain?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So Jaquez thinks, may it please your Greatness,&rdquo; said Bianca.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange
revolution.&nbsp; For my part, I should not be surprised if it was to
happen to-morrow; for, as I was saying, when I heard the clattering
of armour, I was all in a cold sweat.&nbsp; I looked up, and, if your
Greatness will believe me, I saw upon the uppermost banister of the
great stairs a hand in armour as big as big.&nbsp; I thought I should
have swooned.&nbsp; I never stopped until I came hither - would I were
well out of this castle.&nbsp; My Lady Matilda told me but yester-morning
that her Highness Hippolita knows something.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou art an insolent!&rdquo; cried Manfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord
Marquis, it much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront
me.&nbsp; Are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to
my honour?&nbsp; Pursue your claim by manly daring; or let us bury our
feuds, as was proposed, by the intermarriage of our children.&nbsp;
But trust me, it ill becomes a Prince of your bearing to practise on
mercenary wenches.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I scorn your imputation,&rdquo; said Frederic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Until
this hour I never set eyes on this damsel: I have given her no jewel.&nbsp;
My Lord, my Lord, your conscience, your guilt accuses you, and would
throw the suspicion on me; but keep your daughter, and think no more
of Isabella.&nbsp; The judgments already fallen on your house forbid
me matching into it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, alarmed at the resolute tone in which Frederic delivered these
words, endeavoured to pacify him.&nbsp; Dismissing Bianca, he made such
submissions to the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on Matilda,
that Frederic was once more staggered.&nbsp; However, as his passion
was of so recent a date, it could not at once surmount the scruples
he had conceived.&nbsp; He had gathered enough from Bianca&rsquo;s discourse
to persuade him that heaven declared itself against Manfred.&nbsp; The
proposed marriages too removed his claim to a distance; and the principality
of Otranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of
it with Matilda.&nbsp; Still he would not absolutely recede from his
engagements; but purposing to gain time, he demanded of Manfred if it
was true in fact that Hippolita consented to the divorce.&nbsp; The
Prince, transported to find no other obstacle, and depending on his
influence over his wife, assured the Marquis it was so, and that he
might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth.<br>
<br>
As they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was
prepared.&nbsp; Manfred conducted Frederic to the great hall, where
they were received by Hippolita and the young Princesses.&nbsp; Manfred
placed the Marquis next to Matilda, and seated himself between his wife
and Isabella.&nbsp; Hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity;
but the young ladies were silent and melancholy.&nbsp; Manfred, who
was determined to pursue his point with the Marquis in the remainder
of the evening, pushed on the feast until it waxed late; affecting unrestrained
gaiety, and plying Frederic with repeated goblets of wine.&nbsp; The
latter, more upon his guard than Manfred wished, declined his frequent
challenges, on pretence of his late loss of blood; while the Prince,
to raise his own disordered spirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged
himself in plentiful draughts, though not to the intoxication of his
senses.<br>
<br>
The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded.&nbsp; Manfred
would have withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter pleading weakness
and want of repose, retired to his chamber, gallantly telling the Prince
that his daughter should amuse his Highness until himself could attend
him.&nbsp; Manfred accepted the party, and to the no small grief of
Isabella, accompanied her to her apartment.&nbsp; Matilda waited on
her mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of
the castle.<br>
<br>
Soon as the company were dispersed their several ways, Frederic, quitting
his chamber, inquired if Hippolita was alone, and was told by one of
her attendants, who had not noticed her going forth, that at that hour
she generally withdrew to her oratory, where he probably would find
her.&nbsp; The Marquis, during the repast, had beheld Matilda with increase
of passion.&nbsp; He now wished to find Hippolita in the disposition
her Lord had promised.&nbsp; The portents that had alarmed him were
forgotten in his desires.&nbsp; Stealing softly and unobserved to the
apartment of Hippolita, he entered it with a resolution to encourage
her acquiescence to the divorce, having perceived that Manfred was resolved
to make the possession of Isabella an unalterable condition, before
he would grant Matilda to his wishes.<br>
<br>
The Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the Princess&rsquo;s
apartment.&nbsp; Concluding her, as he had been advertised, in her oratory,
he passed on.&nbsp; The door was ajar; the evening gloomy and overcast.&nbsp;
Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling before the altar.&nbsp;
As he approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a long woollen
weed, whose back was towards him.&nbsp; The person seemed absorbed in
prayer.&nbsp; The Marquis was about to return, when the figure, rising,
stood some moments fixed in meditation, without regarding him.&nbsp;
The Marquis, expecting the holy person to come forth, and meaning to
excuse his uncivil interruption, said,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Reverend Father, I sought the Lady Hippolita.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hippolita!&rdquo; replied a hollow voice; &ldquo;camest thou
to this castle to seek Hippolita?&rdquo; and then the figure, turning
slowly round, discovered to Frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets
of a skeleton, wrapt in a hermit&rsquo;s cowl.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Angels of grace protect me!&rdquo; cried Frederic, recoiling.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Deserve their protection!&rdquo; said the Spectre.&nbsp; Frederic,
falling on his knees, adjured the phantom to take pity on him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dost thou not remember me?&rdquo; said the apparition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember the wood of Joppa!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Art thou that holy hermit?&rdquo; cried Frederic, trembling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can I do aught for thy eternal peace?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Wast thou delivered from bondage,&rdquo; said the spectre, &ldquo;to
pursue carnal delights?&nbsp; Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre,
and the behest of Heaven engraven on it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have not, I have not,&rdquo; said Frederic; &ldquo;but say,
blest spirit, what is thy errand to me?&nbsp; What remains to be done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To forget Matilda!&rdquo; said the apparition; and vanished.<br>
<br>
Frederic&rsquo;s blood froze in his veins.&nbsp; For some minutes he
remained motionless.&nbsp; Then falling prostrate on his face before
the altar, he besought the intercession of every saint for pardon.&nbsp;
A flood of tears succeeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous
Matilda rushing in spite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground
in a conflict of penitence and passion.&nbsp; Ere he could recover from
this agony of his spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in her
hand entered the oratory alone.&nbsp; Seeing a man without motion on
the floor, she gave a shriek, concluding him dead.&nbsp; Her fright
brought Frederic to himself.&nbsp; Rising suddenly, his face bedewed
with tears, he would have rushed from her presence; but Hippolita stopping
him, conjured him in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause
of his disorder, and by what strange chance she had found him there
in that posture.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, virtuous Princess!&rdquo; said the Marquis, penetrated with
grief, and stopped.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For the love of Heaven, my Lord,&rdquo; said Hippolita, &ldquo;disclose
the cause of this transport!&nbsp; What mean these doleful sounds, this
alarming exclamation on my name?&nbsp; What woes has heaven still in
store for the wretched Hippolita?&nbsp; Yet silent!&nbsp; By every pitying
angel, I adjure thee, noble Prince,&rdquo; continued she, falling at
his feet, &ldquo;to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart.&nbsp;
I see thou feelest for me; thou feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictest
- speak, for pity!&nbsp; Does aught thou knowest concern my child?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I cannot speak,&rdquo; cried Frederic, bursting from her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, Matilda!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Quitting the Princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own apartment.&nbsp;
At the door of it he was accosted by Manfred, who flushed by wine and
love had come to seek him, and to propose to waste some hours of the
night in music and revelling.&nbsp; Frederic, offended at an invitation
so dissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and
entering his chamber, flung the door intemperately against Manfred,
and bolted it inwards.&nbsp; The haughty Prince, enraged at this unaccountable
behaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses.&nbsp;
As he crossed the court, he was met by the domestic whom he had planted
at the convent as a spy on Jerome and Theodore.&nbsp; This man, almost
breathless with the haste he had made, informed his Lord that Theodore,
and some lady from the castle were, at that instant, in private conference
at the tomb of Alfonso in St. Nicholas&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; He had
dogged Theodore thither, but the gloominess of the night had prevented
his discovering who the woman was.<br>
<br>
Manfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had driven from
her on his urging his passion with too little reserve, did not doubt
but the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience
to meet Theodore.&nbsp; Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged at
her father, he hastened secretly to the great church.&nbsp; Gliding
softly between the aisles, and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine
that shone faintly through the illuminated windows, he stole towards
the tomb of Alfonso, to which he was directed by indistinct whispers
of the persons he sought.&nbsp; The first sounds he could distinguish
were -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Does it, alas! depend on me?&nbsp; Manfred will never permit
our union.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, this shall prevent it!&rdquo; cried the tyrant, drawing his
dagger, and plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person
that spoke.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, me, I am slain!&rdquo; cried Matilda, sinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
heaven, receive my soul!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Savage, inhuman monster, what hast thou done!&rdquo; cried Theodore,
rushing on him, and wrenching his dagger from him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stop, stop thy impious hand!&rdquo; cried Matilda; &ldquo;it
is my father!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manfred, waking as from a trance, beat his breast, twisted his hands
in his locks, and endeavoured to recover his dagger from Theodore to
despatch himself.&nbsp; Theodore, scarce less distracted, and only mastering
the transports of his grief to assist Matilda, had now by his cries
drawn some of the monks to his aid.&nbsp; While part of them endeavoured,
in concert with the afflicted Theodore, to stop the blood of the dying
Princess, the rest prevented Manfred from laying violent hands on himself.<br>
<br>
Matilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged with
looks of grateful love the zeal of Theodore.&nbsp; Yet oft as her faintness
would permit her speech its way, she begged the assistants to comfort
her father.&nbsp; Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and
reached the church.&nbsp; His looks seemed to reproach Theodore, but
turning to Manfred, he said,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Now, tyrant! behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious
and devoted head!&nbsp; The blood of Alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance;
and heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination,
that thou mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince&rsquo;s
sepulchre!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Cruel man!&rdquo; cried Matilda, &ldquo;to aggravate the woes
of a parent; may heaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do!&nbsp;
My Lord, my gracious Sire, dost thou forgive thy child?&nbsp; Indeed,
I came not hither to meet Theodore.&nbsp; I found him praying at this
tomb, whither my mother sent me to intercede for thee, for her - dearest
father, bless your child, and say you forgive her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Forgive thee!&nbsp; Murderous monster!&rdquo; cried Manfred,
&ldquo;can assassins forgive?&nbsp; I took thee for Isabella; but heaven
directed my bloody hand to the heart of my child.&nbsp; Oh, Matilda!
- I cannot utter it - canst thou forgive the blindness of my rage?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can, I do; and may heaven confirm it!&rdquo; said Matilda;
&ldquo;but while I have life to ask it - oh! my mother! what will she
feel?&nbsp; Will you comfort her, my Lord?&nbsp; Will you not put her
away?&nbsp; Indeed she loves you!&nbsp; Oh, I am faint! bear me to the
castle.&nbsp; Can I live to have her close my eyes?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be
borne into the convent; but her instances were so pressing to be carried
to the castle, that placing her on a litter, they conveyed her thither
as she requested.&nbsp; Theodore, supporting her head with his arm,
and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love, still endeavoured
to inspire her with hopes of life.&nbsp; Jerome, on the other side,
comforted her with discourses of heaven, and holding a crucifix before
her, which she bathed with innocent tears, prepared her for her passage
to immortality.&nbsp; Manfred, plunged in the deepest affliction, followed
the litter in despair.<br>
<br>
Ere they reached the castle, Hippolita, informed of the dreadful catastrophe,
had flown to meet her murdered child; but when she saw the afflicted
procession, the mightiness of her grief deprived her of her senses,
and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon.&nbsp; Isabella and Frederic,
who attended her, were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow.&nbsp; Matilda
alone seemed insensible to her own situation: every thought was lost
in tenderness for her mother.<br>
<br>
Ordering the litter to stop, as soon as Hippolita was brought to herself,
she asked for her father.&nbsp; He approached, unable to speak.&nbsp;
Matilda, seizing his hand and her mother&rsquo;s, locked them in her
own, and then clasped them to her heart.&nbsp; Manfred could not support
this act of pathetic piety.&nbsp; He dashed himself on the ground, and
cursed the day he was born.&nbsp; Isabella, apprehensive that these
struggles of passion were more than Matilda could support, took upon
herself to order Manfred to be borne to his apartment, while she caused
Matilda to be conveyed to the nearest chamber.&nbsp; Hippolita, scarce
more alive than her daughter, was regardless of everything but her;
but when the tender Isabella&rsquo;s care would have likewise removed
her, while the surgeons examined Matilda&rsquo;s wound, she cried,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Remove me! never, never!&nbsp; I lived but in her, and will expire
with her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Matilda raised her eyes at her mother&rsquo;s voice, but closed them
again without speaking.&nbsp; Her sinking pulse and the damp coldness
of her hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery.&nbsp; Theodore followed
the surgeons into the outer chamber, and heard them pronounce the fatal
sentence with a transport equal to frenzy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Since she cannot live mine,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;at least
she shall be mine in death!&nbsp; Father!&nbsp; Jerome! will you not
join our hands?&rdquo; cried he to the Friar, who, with the Marquis,
had accompanied the surgeons.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What means thy distracted rashness?&rdquo; said Jerome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is this an hour for marriage?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is, it is,&rdquo; cried Theodore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! there
is no other!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Young man, thou art too unadvised,&rdquo; said Frederic.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dost thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this
hour of fate?&nbsp; What pretensions hast thou to the Princess?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Those of a Prince,&rdquo; said Theodore; &ldquo;of the sovereign
of Otranto.&nbsp; This reverend man, my father, has informed me who
I am.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou ravest,&rdquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no
Prince of Otranto but myself, now Manfred, by murder, by sacrilegious
murder, has forfeited all pretensions.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Jerome, assuming an air of command, &ldquo;he
tells you true.&nbsp; It was not my purpose the secret should have been
divulged so soon, but fate presses onward to its work.&nbsp; What his
hot-headed passion has revealed, my tongue confirms.&nbsp; Know, Prince,
that when Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is this a season for explanations?&rdquo; cried Theodore.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Father, come and unite me to the Princess; she shall be mine!&nbsp;
In every other thing I will dutifully obey you.&nbsp; My life! my adored
Matilda!&rdquo; continued Theodore, rushing back into the inner chamber,
&ldquo;will you not be mine?&nbsp; Will you not bless your - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
Isabella made signs to him to be silent, apprehending the Princess was
near her end.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What, is she dead?&rdquo; cried Theodore; &ldquo;is it possible!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The violence of his exclamations brought Matilda to herself.&nbsp; Lifting
up her eyes, she looked round for her mother.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Life of my soul, I am here!&rdquo; cried Hippolita; &ldquo;think
not I will quit thee!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! you are too good,&rdquo; said Matilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;But weep
not for me, my mother!&nbsp; I am going where sorrow never dwells -
Isabella, thou hast loved me; wouldst thou not supply my fondness to
this dear, dear woman?&nbsp; Indeed I am faint!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! my child! my child!&rdquo; said Hippolita in a flood of tears,
&ldquo;can I not withhold thee a moment?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It will not be,&rdquo; said Matilda; &ldquo;commend me to heaven
- Where is my father? forgive him, dearest mother - forgive him my death;
it was an error.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I had forgotten - dearest mother, I
vowed never to see Theodore more - perhaps that has drawn down this
calamity - but it was not intentional - can you pardon me?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! wound not my agonising soul!&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;thou
never couldst offend me - Alas! she faints! help! help!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I would say something more,&rdquo; said Matilda, struggling,
&ldquo;but it cannot be - Isabella - Theodore - for my sake - Oh! -
&rdquo; she expired.<br>
<br>
Isabella and her women tore Hippolita from the corse; but Theodore threatened
destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it.&nbsp; He printed
a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every expression
that despairing love could dictate.<br>
<br>
Isabella, in the meantime, was accompanying the afflicted Hippolita
to her apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by
Manfred, who, distracted with his own thoughts, and anxious once more
to behold his daughter, was advancing to the chamber where she lay.&nbsp;
As the moon was now at its height, he read in the countenances of this
unhappy company the event he dreaded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What! is she dead?&rdquo; cried he in wild confusion.&nbsp; A
clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to its foundations;
the earth rocked, and the clank of more than mortal armour was heard
behind.&nbsp; Frederic and Jerome thought the last day was at hand.&nbsp;
The latter, forcing Theodore along with them, rushed into the court.&nbsp;
The moment Theodore appeared, the walls of the castle behind Manfred
were thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated
to an immense magnitude, appeared in the centre of the ruins.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!&rdquo; said the
vision: And having pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of
thunder, it ascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting
asunder, the form of St. Nicholas was seen, and receiving Alfonso&rsquo;s
shade, they were soon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.<br>
<br>
The beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging the divine
will.&nbsp; The first that broke silence was Hippolita.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said she to the desponding Manfred, &ldquo;behold
the vanity of human greatness!&nbsp; Conrad is gone!&nbsp; Matilda is
no more!&nbsp; In Theodore we view the true Prince of Otranto.&nbsp;
By what miracle he is so I know not - suffice it to us, our doom is
pronounced! shall we not, can we but dedicate the few deplorable hours
we have to live, in deprecating the further wrath of heaven? heaven
ejects us - whither can we fly, but to yon holy cells that yet offer
us a retreat.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thou guiltless but unhappy woman! unhappy by my crimes!&rdquo;
replied Manfred, &ldquo;my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions.&nbsp;
Oh! could - but it cannot be - ye are lost in wonder - let me at last
do justice on myself!&nbsp; To heap shame on my own head is all the
satisfaction I have left to offer to offended heaven.&nbsp; My story
has drawn down these judgments: Let my confession atone - but, ah! what
can atone for usurpation and a murdered child? a child murdered in a
consecrated place?&nbsp; List, sirs, and may this bloody record be a
warning to future tyrants!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land - ye would interrupt
me; ye would say he came not fairly to his end - it is most true - why
else this bitter cup which Manfred must drink to the dregs.&nbsp; Ricardo,
my grandfather, was his chamberlain - I would draw a veil over my ancestor&rsquo;s
crimes - but it is in vain!&nbsp; Alfonso died by poison.&nbsp; A fictitious
will declared Ricardo his heir.&nbsp; His crimes pursued him - yet he
lost no Conrad, no Matilda!&nbsp; I pay the price of usurpation for
all!&nbsp; A storm overtook him.&nbsp; Haunted by his guilt he vowed
to St. Nicholas to found a church and two convents, if he lived to reach
Otranto.&nbsp; The sacrifice was accepted: the saint appeared to him
in a dream, and promised that Ricardo&rsquo;s posterity should reign
in Otranto until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit
the castle, and as long as issue male from Ricardo&rsquo;s loins should
remain to enjoy it - alas! alas! nor male nor female, except myself,
remains of all his wretched race!&nbsp; I have done - the woes of these
three days speak the rest.&nbsp; How this young man can be Alfonso&rsquo;s
heir I know not - yet I do not doubt it.&nbsp; His are these dominions;
I resign them - yet I knew not Alfonso had an heir - I question not
the will of heaven - poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space,
until Manfred shall be summoned to Ricardo.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What remains is my part to declare,&rdquo; said Jerome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land he was driven by a storm
to the coast of Sicily.&nbsp; The other vessel, which bore Ricardo and
his train, as your Lordship must have heard, was separated from him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is most true,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;and the title you
give me is more than an outcast can claim - well! be it so - proceed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jerome blushed, and continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;For three months Lord Alfonso
was wind-bound in Sicily.&nbsp; There he became enamoured of a fair
virgin named Victoria.&nbsp; He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden
pleasures.&nbsp; They were married.&nbsp; Yet deeming this amour incongruous
with the holy vow of arms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal
their nuptials until his return from the Crusade, when he purposed to
seek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife.&nbsp; He left her pregnant.&nbsp;
During his absence she was delivered of a daughter.&nbsp; But scarce
had she felt a mother&rsquo;s pangs ere she heard the fatal rumour of
her Lord&rsquo;s death, and the succession of Ricardo.&nbsp; What could
a friendless, helpless woman do?&nbsp; Would her testimony avail? -
yet, my lord, I have an authentic writing - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It needs not,&rdquo; said Manfred; &ldquo;the horrors of these
days, the vision we have but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence
beyond a thousand parchments.&nbsp; Matilda&rsquo;s death and my expulsion
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Be composed, my Lord,&rdquo; said Hippolita; &ldquo;this holy
man did not mean to recall your griefs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jerome proceeded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I shall not dwell on what is needless.&nbsp; The daughter of
which Victoria was delivered, was at her maturity bestowed in marriage
on me.&nbsp; Victoria died; and the secret remained locked in my breast.&nbsp;
Theodore&rsquo;s narrative has told the rest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Friar ceased.&nbsp; The disconsolate company retired to the remaining
part of the castle.&nbsp; In the morning Manfred signed his abdication
of the principality, with the approbation of Hippolita, and each took
on them the habit of religion in the neighbouring convents.&nbsp; Frederic
offered his daughter to the new Prince, which Hippolita&rsquo;s tenderness
for Isabella concurred to promote.&nbsp; But Theodore&rsquo;s grief
was too fresh to admit the thought of another love; and it was not until
after frequent discourses with Isabella of his dear Matilda, that he
was persuaded he could know no happiness but in the society of one with
whom he could for ever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession
of his soul.<br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made

ways.

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by

          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to

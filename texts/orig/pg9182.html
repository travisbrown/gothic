<h5 id="id00016">BRETTON.</h5>
<p id="id00017" style="margin-top: 2em">My godmother lived in a
handsome house in the clean and ancient town of Bretton. Her
husband's family had been residents there for generations, and
bore, indeed, the name of their
birthplace&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Bretton of Bretton: whether by
coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a personage
of sufficient importance to leave his name to his neighbourhood, I
know not.</p>
<p id="id00018">When I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a
year, and well I liked the visit. The house and its inmates
specially suited me. The large peaceful rooms, the well-arranged
furniture, the clear wide windows, the balcony outside, looking
down on a fine antique street, where Sundays and holidays seemed
always to abide&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so quiet was its atmosphere, so
clean its pavement&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these things pleased me
well.</p>
<p id="id00019">One child in a household of grown people is usually
made very much of, and in a quiet way I was a good deal taken
notice of by Mrs. Bretton, who had been left a widow, with one son,
before I knew her; her husband, a physician, having died while she
was yet a young and handsome woman.</p>
<p id="id00020">She was not young, as I remember her, but she was
still handsome, tall, well-made, and though dark for an
Englishwoman, yet wearing always the clearness of health in her
brunette cheek, and its vivacity in a pair of fine, cheerful black
eyes. People esteemed it a grievous pity that she had not conferred
her complexion on her son, whose eyes were
blue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though, even in boyhood, very
piercing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and the colour of his long hair such as
friends did not venture to specify, except as the sun shone on it,
when they called it golden. He inherited the lines of his mother's
features, however; also her good teeth, her stature (or the promise
of her stature, for he was not yet full-grown), and, what was
better, her health without flaw, and her spirits of that tone and
equality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.</p>
<p id="id00021">In the autumn of the year
&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; I was staying at Bretton;
my godmother having come in person to claim me of the kinsfolk with
whom was at that time fixed my permanent residence. I believe she
then plainly saw events coming, whose very shadow I scarce guessed;
yet of which the faint suspicion sufficed to impart unsettled
sadness, and made me glad to change scene and society.</p>
<p id="id00022">Time always flowed smoothly for me at my
godmother's side; not with tumultuous swiftness, but blandly, like
the gliding of a full river through a plain. My visits to her
resembled the sojourn of Christian and Hopeful beside a certain
pleasant stream, with "green trees on each bank, and meadows
beautified with lilies all the year round." The charm of variety
there was not, nor the excitement of incident; but I liked peace so
well, and sought stimulus so little, that when the latter came I
almost felt it a disturbance, and wished rather it had still held
aloof.</p>
<p id="id00023">One day a letter was received of which the contents
evidently caused Mrs. Bretton surprise and some concern. I thought
at first it was from home, and trembled, expecting I know not what
disastrous communication: to me, however, no reference was made,
and the cloud seemed to pass.</p>
<p id="id00024">The next day, on my return from a long walk, I
found, as I entered my bedroom, an unexpected change. In, addition
to my own French bed in its shady recess, appeared in a corner a
small crib, draped with white; and in addition to my mahogany chest
of drawers, I saw a tiny rosewood chest. I stood still, gazed, and
considered.</p>
<p id="id00025">"Of what are these things the signs and tokens?" I
asked. The answer was obvious. "A second guest is coming: Mrs.
Bretton expects other visitors."</p>
<p id="id00026">On descending to dinner, explanations ensued. A
little girl, I was told, would shortly be my companion: the
daughter of a friend and distant relation of the late Dr.
Bretton's. This little girl, it was added, had recently lost her
mother; though, indeed, Mrs. Bretton ere long subjoined, the loss
was not so great as might at first appear. Mrs. Home (Home it seems
was the name) had been a very pretty, but a giddy, careless woman,
who had neglected her child, and disappointed and disheartened her
husband. So far from congenial had the union proved, that
separation at last ensued&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;separation by mutual
consent, not after any legal process. Soon after this event, the
lady having over-exerted herself at a ball, caught cold, took a
fever, and died after a very brief illness. Her husband, naturally
a man of very sensitive feelings, and shocked inexpressibly by too
sudden communication of the news, could hardly, it seems, now be
persuaded but that some over-severity on his
part&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some deficiency in patience and
indulgence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had contributed to hasten her end. He
had brooded over this idea till his spirits were seriously
affected; the medical men insisted on travelling being tried as a
remedy, and meanwhile Mrs. Bretton had offered to take charge of
his little girl. "And I hope," added my godmother in conclusion,
"the child will not be like her mamma; as silly and frivolous a
little flirt as ever sensible man was weak enough to marry. For,"
said she, "Mr. Home <i>is</i> a sensible man in his way, though not
very practical: he is fond of science, and lives half his life in a
laboratory trying experiments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a thing his
butterfly wife could neither comprehend nor endure; and indeed"
confessed my godmother, "I should not have liked it myself."</p>
<p id="id00027">In answer to a question of mine, she further
informed me that her late husband used to say, Mr. Home had derived
this scientific turn from a maternal uncle, a French savant; for he
came, it seems; of mixed French and Scottish origin, and had
connections now living in France, of whom more than one wrote
<i>de</i> before his name, and called himself noble.</p>
<p id="id00028">That same evening at nine o'clock, a servant was
despatched to meet the coach by which our little visitor was
expected. Mrs. Bretton and I sat alone in the drawing-room waiting
her coming; John Graham Bretton being absent on a visit to one of
his schoolfellows who lived in the country. My godmother read the
evening paper while she waited; I sewed. It was a wet night; the
rain lashed the panes, and the wind sounded angry and restless.</p>
<p id="id00029">"Poor child!" said Mrs. Bretton from time to time.
"What weather for her journey! I wish she were safe here."</p>
<p id="id00030">A little before ten the door-bell announced
Warren's return. No sooner was the door opened than I ran down into
the hall; there lay a trunk and some band-boxes, beside them stood
a person like a nurse-girl, and at the foot of the staircase was
Warren with a shawled bundle in his arms.</p>
<p id="id00031">"Is that the child?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id00032">"Yes, miss."</p>
<p id="id00033">I would have opened the shawl, and tried to get a
peep at the face, but it was hastily turned from me to Warren's
shoulder.</p>
<p id="id00034">"Put me down, please," said a small voice when
Warren opened the drawing-room door, "and take off this shawl,"
continued the speaker, extracting with its minute hand the pin, and
with a sort of fastidious haste doffing the clumsy wrapping. The
creature which now appeared made a deft attempt to fold the shawl;
but the drapery was much too heavy and large to be sustained or
wielded by those hands and arms. "Give it to Harriet, please," was
then the direction, "and she can put it away." This said, it turned
and fixed its eyes on Mrs. Bretton.</p>
<p id="id00035">"Come here, little dear," said that lady. "Come and
let me see if you are cold and damp: come and let me warm you at
the fire."</p>
<p id="id00036">The child advanced promptly. Relieved of her
wrapping, she appeared exceedingly tiny; but was a neat,
completely-fashioned little figure, light, slight, and straight.
Seated on my godmother's ample lap, she looked a mere doll; her
neck, delicate as wax, her head of silky curls, increased, I
thought, the resemblance.</p>
<p id="id00037">Mrs. Bretton talked in little fond phrases as she
chafed the child's hands, arms, and feet; first she was considered
with a wistful gaze, but soon a smile answered her. Mrs. Bretton
was not generally a caressing woman: even with her deeply-cherished
son, her manner was rarely sentimental, often the reverse; but when
the small stranger smiled at her, she kissed it, asking, "What is
my little one's name?"</p>
<p id="id00038">"Missy."</p>
<p id="id00039">"But besides Missy?"</p>
<p id="id00040">"Polly, papa calls her."</p>
<p id="id00041">"Will Polly be content to live with me?"</p>
<p id="id00042">"Not <i>always</i>; but till papa comes home. Papa
is gone away." She shook her head expressively.</p>
<p id="id00043">"He will return to Polly, or send for her."</p>
<p id="id00044">"Will he, ma'am? Do you know he will?"</p>
<p id="id00045">"I think so."</p>
<p id="id00046">"But Harriet thinks not: at least not for a long
while. He is ill."</p>
<p id="id00047">Her eyes filled. She drew her hand from Mrs.
Bretton's and made a movement to leave her lap; it was at first
resisted, but she said&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Please, I wish to go: I
can sit on a stool."</p>
<p id="id00048">She was allowed to slip down from the knee, and
taking a footstool, she carried it to a corner where the shade was
deep, and there seated herself. Mrs. Bretton, though a commanding,
and in grave matters even a peremptory woman, was often passive in
trifles: she allowed the child her way. She said to me, "Take no
notice at present." But I did take notice: I watched Polly rest her
small elbow on her small knee, her head on her hand; I observed her
draw a square inch or two of pocket-handkerchief from the
doll-pocket of her doll-skirt, and then I heard her weep. Other
children in grief or pain cry aloud, without shame or restraint;
but this being wept: the tiniest occasional sniff testified to her
emotion. Mrs. Bretton did not hear it: which was quite as well. Ere
long, a voice, issuing from the corner,
demanded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"May the bell be rung for Harriet!"</p>
<p id="id00049">I rang; the nurse was summoned and came.</p>
<p id="id00050">"Harriet, I must be put to bed," said her little
mistress. "You must ask where my bed is."</p>
<p id="id00051">Harriet signified that she had already made that
inquiry.</p>
<p id="id00052">"Ask if you sleep with me, Harriet."</p>
<p id="id00053">"No, Missy," said the nurse: "you are to share this
young lady's room," designating me.</p>
<p id="id00054">Missy did not leave her seat, but I saw her eyes
seek me. After some minutes' silent scrutiny, she emerged from her
corner.</p>
<p id="id00055">"I wish you, ma'am, good night," said she to Mrs.
Bretton; but she passed me mute.</p>
<p id="id00056">"Good-night, Polly," I said.</p>
<p id="id00057">"No need to say good-night, since we sleep in the
same chamber," was the reply, with which she vanished from the
drawing-room. We heard Harriet propose to carry her up-stairs. "No
need," was again her answer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"no need, no need:"
and her small step toiled wearily up the staircase.</p>
<p id="id00058">On going to bed an hour afterwards, I found her
still wide awake. She had arranged her pillows so as to support her
little person in a sitting posture: her hands, placed one within
the other, rested quietly on the sheet, with an old-fashioned calm
most unchildlike. I abstained from speaking to her for some time,
but just before extinguishing the light, I recommended her to lie
down.</p>
<p id="id00059">"By and by," was the answer.</p>
<p id="id00060">"But you will take cold, Missy."</p>
<p id="id00061">She took some tiny article of raiment from the
chair at her crib side, and with it covered her shoulders. I
suffered her to do as she pleased. Listening awhile in the
darkness, I was aware that she still wept,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wept
under restraint, quietly and cautiously.</p>
<p id="id00062">On awaking with daylight, a trickling of water
caught my ear. Behold! there she was risen and mounted on a stool
near the washstand, with pains and difficulty inclining the ewer
(which she could not lift) so as to pour its contents into the
basin. It was curious to watch her as she washed and dressed, so
small, busy, and noiseless. Evidently she was little accustomed to
perform her own toilet; and the buttons, strings, hooks and eyes,
offered difficulties which she encountered with a perseverance good
to witness. She folded her night-dress, she smoothed the drapery of
her couch quite neatly; withdrawing into a corner, where the sweep
of the white curtain concealed her, she became still. I half rose,
and advanced my, head to see how she was occupied. On her knees,
with her forehead bent on her hands, I perceived that she was
praying.</p>
<p id="id00063">Her nurse tapped at the door. She started up.</p>
<p id="id00064">"I am dressed, Harriet," said she; "I have dressed
myself, but I do not feel neat. Make me neat!"</p>
<p id="id00065">"Why did you dress yourself, Missy?"</p>
<p id="id00066">"Hush! speak low, Harriet, for fear of waking
<i>the girl</i>" (meaning me, who now lay with my eyes shut). "I
dressed myself to learn, against the time you leave me."</p>
<p id="id00067">"Do you want me to go?"</p>
<p id="id00068">"When you are cross, I have many a time wanted you
to go, but not now.<br />
Tie my sash straight; make my hair smooth, please."<br /></p>
<p id="id00069">"Your sash is straight enough. What a particular
little body you are!"</p>
<p id="id00070">"It must be tied again. Please to tie it."</p>
<p id="id00071">"There, then. When I am gone you must get that
young lady to dress you."</p>
<p id="id00072">"On no account."</p>
<p id="id00073">"Why? She is a very nice young lady. I hope you
mean to behave prettily to her, Missy, and not show your airs."</p>
<p id="id00074">"She shall dress me on no account."</p>
<p id="id00075">"Comical little thing!"</p>
<p id="id00076">"You are not passing the comb straight through my
hair, Harriet; the line will be crooked."</p>
<p id="id00077">"Ay, you are ill to please. Does that suit?"</p>
<p id="id00078">"Pretty well. Where should I go now that I am
dressed?"</p>
<p id="id00079">"I will take you into the breakfast-room."</p>
<p id="id00080">"Come, then."</p>
<p id="id00081">They proceeded to the door. She stopped.</p>
<p id="id00082">"Oh! Harriet, I wish this was papa's house! I don't
know these people."</p>
<p id="id00083">"Be a good child, Missy."</p>
<p id="id00084">"I am good, but I ache here;" putting her hand to
her heart, and moaning while she reiterated, "Papa! papa!"</p>
<p id="id00085">I roused myself and started up, to check this scene
while it was yet within bounds.</p>
<p id="id00086">"Say good-morning to the young lady," dictated
Harriet. She said, "Good-morning," and then followed her nurse from
the room. Harriet temporarily left that same day, to go to her own
friends, who lived in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p id="id00087">On descending, I found Paulina (the child called
herself Polly, but her full name was Paulina Mary) seated at the
breakfast-table, by Mrs. Bretton's side; a mug of milk stood before
her, a morsel of bread filled her hand, which lay passive on the
table-cloth: she was not eating.</p>
<p id="id00088">"How we shall conciliate this little creature,"
said Mrs. Bretton to me, "I don't know: she tastes nothing, and by
her looks, she has not slept."</p>
<p id="id00089">I expressed my confidence in the effects of time
and kindness.</p>
<p id="id00090">"If she were to take a fancy to anybody in the
house, she would soon settle; but not till then," replied Mrs.
Bretton.</p>
<h2 id="id00091" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h5 id="id00092">PAULINA.</h5>
<p id="id00093" style="margin-top: 2em">Some days elapsed, and it
appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy to anybody in
the house. She was not exactly naughty or wilful: she was far from
disobedient; but an object less conducive to
comfort&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to tranquillity
even&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;than she presented, it was scarcely
possible to have before one's eyes. She moped: no grown person
could have performed that uncheering business better; no furrowed
face of adult exile, longing for Europe at Europe's antipodes, ever
bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant
visage. She seemed growing old and unearthly. I, Lucy Snowe, plead
guiltless of that curse, an overheated and discursive imagination;
but whenever, opening a room-door, I found her seated in a corner
alone, her head in her pigmy hand, that room seemed to me not
inhabited, but haunted.</p>
<p id="id00094">And again, when of moonlight nights, on waking, I
beheld her figure, white and conspicuous in its night-dress,
kneeling upright in bed, and praying like some Catholic or
Methodist enthusiast&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some precocious fanatic or
untimely saint&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I scarcely know what thoughts I
had; but they ran risk of being hardly more rational and healthy
than that child's mind must have been.</p>
<p id="id00095">I seldom caught a word of her prayers, for they
were whispered low: sometimes, indeed, they were not whispered at
all, but put up unuttered; such rare sentences as reached my ear
still bore the burden, "Papa; my dear papa!" This, I perceived, was
a one-idea'd nature; betraying that monomaniac tendency I have ever
thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be
cursed.</p>
<p id="id00096">What might have been the end of this fretting, had
it continued unchecked, can only be conjectured: it received,
however, a sudden turn.</p>
<p id="id00097">One afternoon, Mrs. Bretton, coaxing her from her
usual station in a corner, had lifted her into the window-seat,
and, by way of occupying her attention, told her to watch the
passengers and count how many ladies should go down the street in a
given time. She had sat listlessly, hardly looking, and not
counting, when&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my eye being fixed on
hers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I witnessed in its iris and pupil a
startling transfiguration. These sudden, dangerous
natures&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>sensitive</i> as they are
called&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;offer many a curious spectacle to those
whom a cooler temperament has secured from participation in their
angular vagaries. The fixed and heavy gaze swum, trembled, then
glittered in fire; the small, overcast brow cleared; the trivial
and dejected features lit up; the sad countenance vanished, and in
its place appeared a sudden eagerness, an intense expectancy. "It
<i>is</i>!" were her words.</p>
<p id="id00098">Like a bird or a shaft, or any other swift thing,
she was gone from the room, How she got the house-door open I
cannot tell; probably it might be ajar; perhaps Warren was in the
way and obeyed her behest, which would be impetuous enough.
I&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;watching calmly from the
window&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;saw her, in her black frock and tiny
braided apron (to pinafores she had an antipathy), dart half the
length of the street; and, as I was on the point of turning, and
quietly announcing to Mrs. Bretton that the child was run out mad,
and ought instantly to be pursued, I saw her caught up, and rapt at
once from my cool observation, and from the wondering stare of the
passengers. A gentleman had done this good turn, and now, covering
her with his cloak, advanced to restore her to the house whence he
had seen her issue.</p>
<p id="id00099">I concluded he would leave her in a servant's
charge and withdraw; but he entered: having tarried a little while
below, he came up-stairs.</p>
<p id="id00100">His reception immediately explained that he was
known to Mrs. Bretton. She recognised him; she greeted him, and yet
she was fluttered, surprised, taken unawares. Her look and manner
were even expostulatory; and in reply to these, rather than her
words, he said,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I could not help it, madam: I
found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own
eyes how she settled."</p>
<p id="id00101">"But you will unsettle her."</p>
<p id="id00102">"I hope not. And how is papa's little Polly?"</p>
<p id="id00103">This question he addressed to Paulina, as he sat
down and placed her gently on the ground before him.</p>
<p id="id00104">"How is Polly's papa?" was the reply, as she leaned
on his knee, and gazed up into his face.</p>
<p id="id00105">It was not a noisy, not a wordy scene: for that I
was thankful; but it was a scene of feeling too brimful, and which,
because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow, only
oppressed one the more. On all occasions of vehement, unrestrained
expansion, a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the weary
spectator's relief; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that
sort of sensibility which bends of its own will, a giant slave
under the sway of good sense.</p>
<p id="id00106">Mr. Home was a
stern-featured&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps I should rather say, a
hard-featured man: his forehead was knotty, and his cheekbones were
marked and prominent. The character of his face was quite Scotch;
but there was feeling in his eye, and emotion in his now agitated
countenance. His northern accent in speaking harmonised with his
physiognomy. He was at once proud-looking and homely-looking. He
laid his hand on the child's uplifted head. She
said&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Kiss Polly."</p>
<p id="id00107">He kissed her. I wished she would utter some
hysterical cry, so that I might get relief and be at ease. She made
wonderfully little noise: she seemed to have got what she
wanted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>all</i> she wanted, and to be in a
trance of content. Neither in mien nor in features was this
creature like her sire, and yet she was of his strain: her mind had
been filled from his, as the cup from the flagon.</p>
<p id="id00108">Indisputably, Mr. Home owned manly self-control,
however he might secretly feel on some matters. "Polly," he said,
looking down on his little girl, "go into the hall; you will see
papa's great-coat lying on a chair; put your hand into the pockets,
you will find a pocket-handkerchief there; bring it to me."</p>
<p id="id00109">She obeyed; went and returned deftly and nimbly. He
was talking to Mrs. Bretton when she came back, and she waited with
the handkerchief in her hand. It was a picture, in its way, to see
her, with her tiny stature, and trim, neat shape, standing at his
knee. Seeing that he continued to talk, apparently unconscious of
her return, she took his hand, opened the unresisting fingers,
insinuated into them the handkerchief, and closed them upon it one
by one. He still seemed not to see or to feel her; but by-and-by,
he lifted her to his knee; she nestled against him, and though
neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an hour following, I
suppose both were satisfied.</p>
<p id="id00110">During tea, the minute thing's movements and
behaviour gave, as usual, full occupation to the eye. First she
directed Warren, as he placed the chairs.</p>
<p id="id00111">"Put papa's chair here, and mine near it, between
papa and Mrs.<br />
Bretton: <i>I</i> must hand his tea."<br /></p>
<p id="id00112">She took her own seat, and beckoned with her hand
to her father.</p>
<p id="id00113">"Be near me, as if we were at home, papa."</p>
<p id="id00114">And again, as she intercepted his cup in passing,
and would stir the sugar, and put in the cream herself, "I always
did it for you at home; papa: nobody could do it as well, not even
your own self."</p>
<p id="id00115">Throughout the meal she continued her attentions:
rather absurd they were. The sugar-tongs were too wide for one of
her hands, and she had to use both in wielding them; the weight of
the silver cream-ewer, the bread-and-butter plates, the very cup
and saucer, tasked her insufficient strength and dexterity; but she
would lift this, hand that, and luckily contrived through it all to
break nothing. Candidly speaking, I thought her a little busy-body;
but her father, blind like other parents, seemed perfectly content
to let her wait on him, and even wonderfully soothed by her
offices.</p>
<p id="id00116">"She is my comfort!" he could not help saying to
Mrs. Bretton. That lady had her own "comfort" and nonpareil on a
much larger scale, and, for the moment, absent; so she sympathised
with his foible.</p>
<p id="id00117">This second "comfort" came on the stage in the
course of the evening. I knew this day had been fixed for his
return, and was aware that Mrs. Bretton had been expecting him
through all its hours. We were seated round the fire, after tea,
when Graham joined our circle: I should rather say, broke it
up&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for, of course, his arrival made a bustle;
and then, as Mr. Graham was fasting, there was refreshment to be
provided. He and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance; of the little
girl he took no notice for a time.</p>
<p id="id00118">His meal over, and numerous questions from his
mother answered, he turned from the table to the hearth. Opposite
where he had placed himself was seated Mr. Home, and at his elbow,
the child. When I say <i>child</i> I use an inappropriate and
undescriptive term&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a term suggesting any picture
rather than that of the demure little person in a mourning frock
and white chemisette, that might just have fitted a good-sized
doll&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perched now on a high chair beside a stand,
whereon was her toy work-box of white varnished wood, and holding
in her hands a shred of a handkerchief, which she was professing to
hem, and at which she bored perseveringly with a needle, that in
her fingers seemed almost a skewer, pricking herself ever and anon,
marking the cambric with a track of minute red dots; occasionally
starting when the perverse weapon&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;swerving from
her control&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;inflicted a deeper stab than usual;
but still silent, diligent, absorbed, womanly.</p>
<p id="id00119">Graham was at that time a handsome,
faithless-looking youth of sixteen. I say faithless-looking, not
because he was really of a very perfidious disposition, but because
the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair, Celtic (not
Saxon) character of his good looks; his waved light auburn hair,
his supple symmetry, his smile frequent, and destitute neither of
fascination nor of subtlety (in no bad sense). A spoiled, whimsical
boy he was in those days.</p>
<p id="id00120">"Mother," he said, after eyeing the little figure
before him in silence for some time, and when the temporary absence
of Mr. Home from the room relieved him from the half-laughing
bashfulness, which was all he knew of
timidity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;-"Mother, I see a young lady in the
present society to whom I have not been introduced."</p>
<p id="id00121">"Mr. Home's little girl, I suppose you mean," said
his mother.</p>
<p id="id00122">"Indeed, ma'am," replied her son, "I consider your
expression of the least ceremonious: Miss Home <i>I</i> should
certainly have said, in venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to
whom I allude."</p>
<p id="id00123">"Now, Graham, I will not have that child teased.
Don't flatter yourself that I shall suffer you to make her your
butt."</p>
<p id="id00124">"Miss Home," pursued Graham, undeterred by his
mother's remonstrance, "might I have the honour to introduce
myself, since no one else seems willing to render you and me that
service? Your slave, John Graham Bretton."</p>
<p id="id00125">She looked at him; he rose and bowed quite gravely.
She deliberately put down thimble, scissors, work; descended with
precaution from her perch, and curtsying with unspeakable
seriousness, said, "How do you do?"</p>
<p id="id00126">"I have the honour to be in fair health, only in
some measure fatigued with a hurried journey. I hope, ma'am, I see
you well?"</p>
<p id="id00127">"Tor-rer-ably well," was the ambitious reply of the
little woman and she now essayed to regain her former elevation,
but finding this could not be done without some climbing and
straining&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sacrifice of decorum not to be
thought of&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and being utterly disdainful of aid
in the presence of a strange young gentleman, she relinquished the
high chair for a low stool: towards that low stool Graham drew in
his chair.</p>
<p id="id00128">"I hope, ma'am, the present residence, my mother's
house, appears to you a convenient place of abode?"</p>
<p id="id00129">"Not par-tic-er-er-ly; I want to go home."</p>
<p id="id00130">"A natural and laudable desire, ma'am; but one
which, notwithstanding,<br />
I shall do my best to oppose. I reckon on being able to get out of
you<br />
a little of that precious commodity called amusement, which mamma
and<br />
Mistress Snowe there fail to yield me."<br /></p>
<p id="id00131">"I shall have to go with papa soon: I shall not
stay long at your mother's."</p>
<p id="id00132">"Yes, yes; you will stay with me, I am sure. I have
a pony on which you shall ride, and no end of books with pictures
to show you."</p>
<p id="id00133">"Are <i>you</i> going to live here now?"</p>
<p id="id00134">"I am. Does that please you? Do you like me?"</p>
<p id="id00135">"No."</p>
<p id="id00136">"Why?"</p>
<p id="id00137">"I think you queer."</p>
<p id="id00138">"My face, ma'am?"</p>
<p id="id00139">"Your face and all about you: You have long red
hair."</p>
<p id="id00140">"Auburn hair, if you please: mamma, calls it
auburn, or golden, and so do all her friends. But even with my
'long red hair'" (and he waved his mane with a sort of
triumph&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;tawny he himself well knew that it was,
and he was proud of the leonine hue), "I cannot possibly be queerer
than is your ladyship."</p>
<p id="id00141">"You call me queer?"</p>
<p id="id00142">"Certainly."</p>
<p id="id00143">(After a pause), "I think I shall go to bed."</p>
<p id="id00144">"A little thing like you ought to have been in bed
many hours since; but you probably sat up in the expectation of
seeing me?"</p>
<p id="id00145">"No, indeed."</p>
<p id="id00146">"You certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my
society. You knew I was coming home, and would wait to have a look
at me."</p>
<p id="id00147">"I sat up for papa, and not for you."</p>
<p id="id00148">"Very good, Miss Home. I am going to be a
favourite: preferred before papa soon, I daresay."</p>
<p id="id00149">She wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night; she
seemed hesitating whether Graham's deserts entitled him to the same
attention, when he caught her up with one hand, and with that one
hand held her poised aloft above his head. She saw herself thus
lifted up on high, in the glass over the fireplace. The suddenness,
the freedom, the disrespect of the action were too much.</p>
<p id="id00150">"For shame, Mr. Graham!" was her indignant cry,
"put me down!"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and when again on her feet, "I
wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in that
way, lifting you with my hand" (raising that mighty member) "as
Warren lifts the little cat."</p>
<p id="id00151">So saying, she departed.</p>
<h2 id="id00152" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h5 id="id00153">THE PLAYMATES.</h5>
<p id="id00154" style="margin-top: 2em">Mr. Home stayed two days.
During his visit he could not be prevailed on to go out: he sat all
day long by the fireside, sometimes silent, sometimes receiving and
answering Mrs. Bretton's chat, which was just of the proper sort
for a man in his morbid mood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not
over-sympathetic, yet not too uncongenial, sensible; and even with
a touch of the motherly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she was sufficiently his
senior to be permitted this touch.</p>
<p id="id00155">As to Paulina, the child was at once happy and
mute, busy and watchful.<br />
Her father frequently lifted her to his knee; she would sit there
till<br />
she felt or fancied he grew restless; then it
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Papa, put me down;<br />
I shall tire you with my weight."<br /></p>
<p id="id00156">And the mighty burden slid to the rug, and
establishing itself on carpet or stool just at "papa's" feet, the
white work-box and the scarlet-speckled handkerchief came into
play. This handkerchief, it seems, was intended as a keepsake for
"papa," and must be finished before his departure; consequently the
demand on the sempstress's industry (she accomplished about a score
of stitches in half-an-hour) was stringent.</p>
<p id="id00157">The evening, by restoring Graham to the maternal
roof (his days were passed at school), brought us an accession of
animation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a quality not diminished by the nature
of the scenes pretty sure to be enacted between him and Miss
Paulina.</p>
<p id="id00158">A distant and haughty demeanour had been the result
of the indignity put upon her the first evening of his arrival: her
usual answer, when he addressed her, was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I
can't attend to you; I have other things to think about." Being
implored to state <i>what</i> things:</p>
<p id="id00159">"Business."</p>
<p id="id00160">Graham would endeavour to seduce her attention by
opening his desk and displaying its multifarious contents: seals,
bright sticks of wax, pen-knives, with a miscellany of
engravings&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some of them gaily
coloured&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which he had amassed from time to time.
Nor was this powerful temptation wholly unavailing: her eyes,
furtively raised from her work, cast many a peep towards the
writing-table, rich in scattered pictures. An etching of a child
playing with a Blenheim spaniel happened to flutter to the
floor.</p>
<p id="id00161">"Pretty little dog!" said she, delighted.</p>
<p id="id00162">Graham prudently took no notice. Ere long, stealing
from her corner, she approached to examine the treasure more
closely. The dog's great eyes and long ears, and the child's hat
and feathers, were irresistible.</p>
<p id="id00163">"Nice picture!" was her favourable criticism.</p>
<p id="id00164">"Well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you may have it," said
Graham.</p>
<p id="id00165">She seemed to hesitate. The wish to possess was
strong, but to accept would be a compromise of dignity. No. She put
it down and turned away.</p>
<p id="id00166">"You won't have it, then, Polly?"</p>
<p id="id00167">"I would rather not, thank you."</p>
<p id="id00168">"Shall I tell you what I will do with the picture
if you refuse it?"</p>
<p id="id00169">She half turned to listen.</p>
<p id="id00170">"Cut it into strips for lighting the taper."</p>
<p id="id00171">"No!"</p>
<p id="id00172">"But I shall."</p>
<p id="id00173">"Please&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;don't."</p>
<p id="id00174">Graham waxed inexorable on hearing the pleading
tone; he took the scissors from his mother's work-basket.</p>
<p id="id00175">"Here goes!" said he, making a menacing flourish.
"Right through Fido's head, and splitting little Harry's nose."</p>
<p id="id00176">"No! <i>No!</i> NO!"</p>
<p id="id00177">"Then come to me. Come quickly, or it is done."</p>
<p id="id00178">She hesitated, lingered, but complied.</p>
<p id="id00179">"Now, will you have it?" he asked, as she stood
before him.</p>
<p id="id00180">"Please."</p>
<p id="id00181">"But I shall want payment."</p>
<p id="id00182">"How much?"</p>
<p id="id00183">"A kiss."</p>
<p id="id00184">"Give the picture first into my hand."</p>
<p id="id00185">Polly, as she said this, looked rather faithless in
her turn. Graham gave it. She absconded a debtor, darted to her
father, and took refuge on his knee. Graham rose in mimic wrath and
followed. She buried her face in Mr. Home's waistcoat.</p>
<p id="id00186">
"Papa&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;papa&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;send him
away!"</p>
<p id="id00187">"I'll not be sent away," said Graham.</p>
<p id="id00188">With face still averted, she held out her hand to
keep him off</p>
<p id="id00189">"Then, I shall kiss the hand," said he; but that
moment it became a miniature fist, and dealt him payment in a small
coin that was not kisses.</p>
<p id="id00190">Graham&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not failing in his way to
be as wily as his little playmate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;retreated
apparently quite discomfited; he flung himself on a sofa, and
resting his head against the cushion, lay like one in pain. Polly,
finding him silent, presently peeped at him. His eyes and face were
covered with his hands. She turned on her father's knee, and gazed
at her foe anxiously and long. Graham groaned.</p>
<p id="id00191">"Papa, what is the matter?" she whispered.</p>
<p id="id00192">"You had better ask him, Polly."</p>
<p id="id00193">"Is he hurt?" (groan second.)</p>
<p id="id00194">"He makes a noise as if he were," said Mr.
Home.</p>
<p id="id00195">"Mother," suggested Graham, feebly, "I think you
had better send for the doctor. Oh my eye!" (renewed silence,
broken only by sighs from Graham.)</p>
<p id="id00196">"If I were to become
blind&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?" suggested this
last.</p>
<p id="id00197">His chastiser could not bear the suggestion. She
was beside him directly.</p>
<p id="id00198">"Let me see your eye: I did not mean to touch it,
only your mouth; and<br />
I did not think I hit so <i>very</i> hard."<br /></p>
<p id="id00199">Silence answered her. Her features
worked,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I am sorry; I am sorry!"</p>
<p id="id00200">Then succeeded emotion, faltering; weeping.</p>
<p id="id00201">"Have done trying that child, Graham," said Mrs.
Bretton.</p>
<p id="id00202">"It is all nonsense, my pet," cried Mr. Home.</p>
<p id="id00203">And Graham once more snatched her aloft, and she
again punished him; and while she pulled his lion's locks, termed
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"The naughtiest, rudest, worst, untruest
person that ever was."</p>
<p id="id00204">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id00205">On the morning of Mr. Home's departure, he and his
daughter had some conversation in a window-recess by themselves; I
heard part of it.</p>
<p id="id00206">"Couldn't I pack my box and go with you, papa?" she
whispered earnestly.</p>
<p id="id00207">He shook his head.</p>
<p id="id00208">"Should I be a trouble to you?"</p>
<p id="id00209">"Yes, Polly."</p>
<p id="id00210">"Because I am little?"</p>
<p id="id00211">"Because you are little and tender. It is only
great, strong people that should travel. But don't look sad, my
little girl; it breaks my heart. Papa, will soon come back to his
Polly."</p>
<p id="id00212">"Indeed, indeed, I am not sad, scarcely at
all."</p>
<p id="id00213">"Polly would be sorry to give papa pain; would she
not?"</p>
<p id="id00214">"Sorrier than sorry."</p>
<p id="id00215">"Then Polly must be cheerful: not cry at parting;
not fret afterwards.<br />
She must look forward to meeting again, and try to be happy
meanwhile.<br />
Can she do this?"<br /></p>
<p id="id00216">"She will try."</p>
<p id="id00217">"I see she will. Farewell, then. It is time to
go."</p>
<p id="id00218">"<i>Now</i>?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;just
<i>now</i>?</p>
<p id="id00219">"Just now."</p>
<p id="id00220">She held up quivering lips. Her father sobbed, but
she, I remarked, did not. Having put her down, he shook hands with
the rest present, and departed.</p>
<p id="id00221">When the street-door closed, she dropped on her
knees at a chair with a cry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Papa!"</p>
<p id="id00222">It was low and long; a sort of "Why hast thou
forsaken me?" During an ensuing space of some minutes, I perceived
she endured agony. She went through, in that brief interval of her
infant life, emotions such as some never feel; it was in her
constitution: she would have more of such instants if she lived.
Nobody spoke. Mrs. Bretton, being a mother, shed a tear or two.
Graham, who was writing, lifted up his eyes and gazed at her. I,
Lucy Snowe, was calm.</p>
<p id="id00223">The little creature, thus left unharassed, did for
herself what none other could do&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;contended with
an intolerable feeling; and, ere long, in some degree, repressed
it. That day she would accept solace from none; nor the next day:
she grew more passive afterwards.</p>
<p id="id00224">On the third evening, as she sat on the floor, worn
and quiet, Graham, coming in, took her up gently, without a word.
She did not resist: she rather nestled in his arms, as if weary.
When he sat down, she laid her head against him; in a few minutes
she slept; he carried her upstairs to bed. I was not surprised
that, the next morning, the first thing she demanded was, "Where is
Mr. Graham?"</p>
<p id="id00225">It happened that Graham was not coming to the
breakfast-table; he had some exercises to write for that morning's
class, and had requested his mother to send a cup of tea into the
study. Polly volunteered to carry it: she must be busy about
something, look after somebody. The cup was entrusted to her; for,
if restless, she was also careful. As the study was opposite the
breakfast-room, the doors facing across the passage, my eye
followed her.</p>
<p id="id00226">"What are you doing?" she asked, pausing on the
threshold.</p>
<p id="id00227">"Writing," said Graham.</p>
<p id="id00228">"Why don't you come to take breakfast with your
mamma?"</p>
<p id="id00229">"Too busy."</p>
<p id="id00230">"Do you want any breakfast?"</p>
<p id="id00231">"Of course."</p>
<p id="id00232">"There, then."</p>
<p id="id00233">And she deposited the cup on the carpet, like a
jailor putting a prisoner's pitcher of water through his cell-door,
and retreated. Presently she returned.</p>
<p id="id00234">"What will you have besides
tea&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what to eat?"</p>
<p id="id00235">"Anything good. Bring me something particularly
nice; that's a kind little woman."</p>
<p id="id00236">She came back to Mrs. Bretton.</p>
<p id="id00237">"Please, ma'am, send your boy something good."</p>
<p id="id00238">"You shall choose for him, Polly; what shall my boy
have?"</p>
<p id="id00239">She selected a portion of whatever was best on the
table; and, ere long, came back with a whispered request for some
marmalade, which was not there. Having got it, however, (for Mrs.
Bretton refused the pair nothing), Graham was shortly after heard
lauding her to the skies; promising that, when he had a house of
his own, she should be his housekeeper, and
perhaps&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if she showed any culinary
genius&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his cook; and, as she did not return, and
I went to look after her, I found Graham and her breakfasting
<i>t&Atilde;&ordf;te-&Atilde;&nbsp;-t&Atilde;&ordf;te</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she
standing at his elbow, and sharing his fare: excepting the
marmalade, which she delicately refused to touch, lest, I suppose,
it should appear that she had procured it as much on her own
account as his. She constantly evinced these nice perceptions and
delicate instincts.</p>
<p id="id00240">The league of acquaintanceship thus struck up was
not hastily dissolved; on the contrary, it appeared that time and
circumstances served rather to cement than loosen it.
Ill-assimilated as the two were in age, sex, pursuits, &amp;c.,
they somehow found a great deal to say to each other. As to
Paulina, I observed that her little character never properly came
out, except with young Bretton. As she got settled, and accustomed
to the house, she proved tractable enough with Mrs. Bretton; but
she would sit on a stool at that lady's feet all day long, learning
her task, or sewing, or drawing figures with a pencil on a slate,
and never kindling once to originality, or showing a single gleam
of the peculiarities of her nature. I ceased to watch her under
such circumstances: she was not interesting. But the moment
Graham's knock sounded of an evening, a change occurred; she was
instantly at the head of the staircase. Usually her welcome was a
reprimand or a threat.</p>
<p id="id00241">"You have not wiped your shoes properly on the mat.
I shall tell your mamma."</p>
<p id="id00242">"Little busybody! Are you there?"</p>
<p id="id00243">"Yes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and you can't reach me: I
am higher up than you" (peeping between the rails of the banister;
she could not look over them).</p>
<p id="id00244">"Polly!"</p>
<p id="id00245">"My dear boy!" (such was one of her terms for him,
adopted in imitation of his mother.)</p>
<p id="id00246">"I am fit to faint with fatigue," declared Graham,
leaning against the passage-wall in seeming exhaustion. "Dr. Digby"
(the headmaster) "has quite knocked me up with overwork. Just come
down and help me to carry up my books."</p>
<p id="id00247">"Ah! you're cunning!"</p>
<p id="id00248">"Not at all, Polly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is
positive fact. I'm as weak as a rush. Come down."</p>
<p id="id00249">"Your eyes are quiet like the cat's, but you'll
spring."</p>
<p id="id00250">"Spring? Nothing of the kind: it isn't in me. Come
down."</p>
<p id="id00251">"Perhaps I may&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if you'll promise
not to touch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not to snatch me up, and not to
whirl me round."</p>
<p id="id00252">"I? I couldn't do it!" (sinking into a chair.)</p>
<p id="id00253">"Then put the books down on the first step, and go
three yards off"</p>
<p id="id00254">This being done, she descended warily, and not
taking her eyes from the feeble Graham. Of course her approach
always galvanized him to new and spasmodic life: the game of romps
was sure to be exacted. Sometimes she would be angry; sometimes the
matter was allowed to pass smoothly, and we could hear her say as
she led him up-stairs: "Now, my dear boy, come and take your
tea&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am sure you must want something."</p>
<p id="id00255">It was sufficiently comical to observe her as she
sat beside Graham, while he took that meal. In his absence she was
a still personage, but with him the most officious, fidgety little
body possible. I often wished she would mind herself and be
tranquil; but no&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;herself was forgotten in him:
he could not be sufficiently well waited on, nor carefully enough
looked after; he was more than the Grand Turk in her estimation.
She would gradually assemble the various plates before him, and,
when one would suppose all he could possibly desire was within his
reach, she would find out something else: "Ma'am," she would
whisper to Mrs. Bretton,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"perhaps your son would
like a little cake&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sweet cake, you
know&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there is some in there" (pointing to the
sideboard cupboard). Mrs. Bretton, as a rule, disapproved of sweet
cake at tea, but still the request was
urged,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"One little piece&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;only
for him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as he goes to school:
girls&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such as me and Miss
Snowe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;don't need treats, but <i>he</i> would
like it."</p>
<p id="id00256">Graham did like it very well, and almost always got
it. To do him justice, he would have shared his prize with her to
whom he owed it; but that was never allowed: to insist, was to
ruffle her for the evening. To stand by his knee, and monopolize
his talk and notice, was the reward she
wanted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not a share of the cake.</p>
<p id="id00257">With curious readiness did she adapt herself to
such themes as interested him. One would have thought the child had
no mind or life of her own, but must necessarily live, move, and
have her being in another: now that her father was taken from her,
she nestled to Graham, and seemed to feel by his feelings: to exist
in his existence. She learned the names of all his schoolfellows in
a trice: she got by heart their characters as given from his lips:
a single description of an individual seemed to suffice. She never
forgot, or confused identities: she would talk with him the whole
evening about people she had never seen, and appear completely to
realise their aspect, manners, and dispositions. Some she learned
to mimic: an under-master, who was an aversion of young Bretton's,
had, it seems, some peculiarities, which she caught up in a moment
from Graham's representation, and rehearsed for his amusement;
this, however, Mrs. Bretton disapproved and forbade.</p>
<p id="id00258">The pair seldom quarrelled; yet once a rupture
occurred, in which her feelings received a severe shock.</p>
<p id="id00259">One day Graham, on the occasion of his birthday,
had some friends&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;lads of his own
age&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to dine with him. Paulina took much interest
in the coming of these friends; she had frequently heard of them;
they were amongst those of whom Graham oftenest spoke. After
dinner, the young gentlemen were left by themselves in the
dining-room, where they soon became very merry and made a good deal
of noise. Chancing to pass through the hall, I found Paulina
sitting alone on the lowest step of the staircase, her eyes fixed
on the glossy panels of the dining-room door, where the reflection
of the hall-lamp was shining; her little brow knit in anxious,
meditation.</p>
<p id="id00260">"What are you thinking about, Polly?"</p>
<p id="id00261">"Nothing particular; only I wish that door was
clear glass&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that I might see through it. The
boys seem very cheerful, and I want to go to them: I want to be
with Graham, and watch his friends."</p>
<p id="id00262">"What hinders you from going?"</p>
<p id="id00263">"I feel afraid: but may I try, do you think? May I
knock at the door, and ask to be let in?"</p>
<p id="id00264">I thought perhaps they might not object to have her
as a playmate, and therefore encouraged the attempt.</p>
<p id="id00265">She knocked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too faintly at first
to be heard, but on a second essay the door unclosed; Graham's head
appeared; he looked in high spirits, but impatient.</p>
<p id="id00266">"What do you want, you little monkey?"</p>
<p id="id00267">"To come to you."</p>
<p id="id00268">"Do you indeed? As if I would be troubled with you!
Away to mamma and Mistress Snowe, and tell them to put you to bed."
The auburn head and bright flushed face
vanished,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the door shut peremptorily. She was
stunned.</p>
<p id="id00269">"Why does he speak so? He never spoke so before,"
she said in consternation. "What have I done?"</p>
<p id="id00270">"Nothing, Polly; but Graham is busy with his
school-friends."</p>
<p id="id00271">"And he likes them better than me! He turns me away
now they are here!"</p>
<p id="id00272">I had some thoughts of consoling her, and of
improving the occasion by inculcating some of those maxims of
philosophy whereof I had ever a tolerable stock ready for
application. She stopped me, however, by putting her fingers in her
ears at the first words I uttered, and then lying down on the mat
with her face against the flags; nor could either Warren or the
cook root her from that position: she was allowed to lie,
therefore, till she chose to rise of her own accord.</p>
<p id="id00273">Graham forgot his impatience the same evening, and
would have accosted her as usual when his friends were gone, but
she wrenched herself from his hand; her eye quite flashed; she
would not bid him good-night; she would not look in his face. The
next day he treated her with indifference, and she grew like a bit
of marble. The day after, he teased her to know what was the
matter; her lips would not unclose. Of course he could not feel
real anger on his side: the match was too unequal in every way; he
tried soothing and coaxing. "Why was she so angry? What had he
done?" By-and-by tears answered him; he petted her, and they were
friends. But she was one on whom such incidents were not lost: I
remarked that never after this rebuff did she seek him, or follow
him, or in any way solicit his notice. I told her once to carry a
book or some other article to Graham when he was shut up in his
study.</p>
<p id="id00274">"I shall wait till he comes out," said she,
proudly; "I don't choose to give him the trouble of rising to open
the door."</p>
<p id="id00275">Young Bretton had a favourite pony on which he
often rode out; from the window she always watched his departure
and return. It was her ambition to be permitted to have a ride
round the courtyard on this pony; but far be it from her to ask
such a favour. One day she descended to the yard to watch him
dismount; as she leaned against the gate, the longing wish for the
indulgence of a ride glittered in her eye.</p>
<p id="id00276">"Come, Polly, will you have a canter?" asked
Graham, half carelessly.</p>
<p id="id00277">I suppose she thought he was <i>too</i>
careless.</p>
<p id="id00278">"No, thank you," said she, turning away with the
utmost coolness.</p>
<p id="id00279">"You'd better," pursued he. "You will like it, I am
sure."</p>
<p id="id00280">"Don't think I should care a fig about it," was the
response.</p>
<p id="id00281">"That is not true. You told Lucy Snowe you longed
to have a ride."</p>
<p id="id00282">"Lucy Snowe is a <i>tatter</i>-box," I heard her
say (her imperfect articulation was the least precocious thing she
had about her); and with this; she walked into the house.</p>
<p id="id00283">Graham, coming in soon after, observed to his
mother,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Mamma, I believe that creature is a
changeling: she is a perfect cabinet of oddities; but I should be
dull without her: she amuses me a great deal more than you or Lucy
Snowe."</p>
<p id="id00284">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id00285">"Miss Snowe," said Paulina to me (she had now got
into the habit of occasionally chatting with me when we were alone
in our room at night), "do you know on what day in the week I like
Graham best?"</p>
<p id="id00286">"How can I possibly know anything so strange? Is
there one day out of the seven when he is otherwise than on the
other six?"</p>
<p id="id00287">"To be sure! Can't you see? Don't you know? I find
him the most excellent on a Sunday; then we have him the whole day,
and he is quiet, and, in the evening, <i>so</i> kind."</p>
<p id="id00288">This observation was not altogether groundless:
going to church, &amp;c., kept Graham quiet on the Sunday, and the
evening he generally dedicated to a serene, though rather indolent
sort of enjoyment by the parlour fireside. He would take possession
of the couch, and then he would call Polly.</p>
<p id="id00289">Graham was a boy not quite as other boys are; all
his delight did not lie in action: he was capable of some intervals
of contemplation; he could take a pleasure too in reading, nor was
his selection of books wholly indiscriminate: there were
glimmerings of characteristic preference, and even of instinctive
taste in the choice. He rarely, it is true, remarked on what he
read, but I have seen him sit and think of it.</p>
<p id="id00290">Polly, being near him, kneeling on a little cushion
or the carpet, a conversation would begin in murmurs, not
inaudible, though subdued. I caught a snatch of their tenor now and
then; and, in truth, some influence better and finer than that of
every day, seemed to soothe Graham at such times into no ungentle
mood.</p>
<p id="id00291">"Have you learned any hymns this week, Polly?"</p>
<p id="id00292">"I have learned a very pretty one, four verses
long. Shall I say it?"</p>
<p id="id00293">"Speak nicely, then: don't be in a hurry."</p>
<p id="id00294">The hymn being rehearsed, or rather half-chanted,
in a little singing voice, Graham would take exceptions at the
manner, and proceed to give a lesson in recitation. She was quick
in learning, apt in imitating; and, besides, her pleasure was to
please Graham: she proved a ready scholar. To the hymn would
succeed some reading&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps a chapter in the
Bible; correction was seldom required here, for the child could
read any simple narrative chapter very well; and, when the subject
was such as she could understand and take an interest in, her
expression and emphasis were something remarkable. Joseph cast into
the pit; the calling of Samuel; Daniel in the lions'
den;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these were favourite passages: of the first
especially she seemed perfectly to feel the pathos.</p>
<p id="id00295">"Poor Jacob!" she would sometimes say, with
quivering lips. "How he loved his son Joseph! As much," she once
added&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"as much, Graham, as I love you: if you
were to die" (and she re-opened the book, sought the verse, and
read), "I should refuse to be comforted, and go down into the grave
to you mourning."</p>
<p id="id00296">With these words she gathered Graham in her little
arms, drawing his long-tressed head towards her. The action, I
remember, struck me as strangely rash; exciting the feeling one
might experience on seeing an animal dangerous by nature, and but
half-tamed by art, too heedlessly fondled. Not that I feared Graham
would hurt, or very roughly check her; but I thought she ran risk
of incurring such a careless, impatient repulse, as would be worse
almost to her than a blow. On: the whole, however, these
demonstrations were borne passively: sometimes even a sort of
complacent wonder at her earnest partiality would smile not
unkindly in his eyes. Once he said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"You like me
almost as well as if you were my little sister, Polly."</p>
<p id="id00297">"Oh! I <i>do</i> like you," said she; "I <i>do</i>
like you very much."</p>
<p id="id00298">I was not long allowed the amusement of this study
of character. She had scarcely been at Bretton two months, when a
letter came from Mr. Home, signifying that he was now settled
amongst his maternal kinsfolk on the Continent; that, as England
was become wholly distasteful to him, he had no thoughts of
returning hither, perhaps, for years; and that he wished his little
girl to join him immediately.</p>
<p id="id00299">"I wonder how she will take this news?" said Mrs.
Bretton, when she had read the letter. <i>I</i> wondered, too, and
I took upon myself to communicate it.</p>
<p id="id00300">Repairing to the drawing-room&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in
which calm and decorated apartment she was fond of being alone, and
where she could be implicitly trusted, for she fingered nothing, or
rather soiled nothing she fingered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I found her
seated, like a little Odalisque, on a couch, half shaded by the
drooping draperies of the window near. She seemed happy; all her
appliances for occupation were about her; the white wood workbox, a
shred or two of muslin, an end or two of ribbon collected for
conversion into doll-millinery. The doll, duly night-capped and
night-gowned, lay in its cradle; she was rocking it to sleep, with
an air of the most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and
somnolent faculties; her eyes, at the same time, being engaged with
a picture-book, which lay open on her lap.</p>
<p id="id00301">"Miss Snowe," said she in a whisper, "this is a
wonderful book. Candace" (the doll, christened by Graham; for,
indeed, its begrimed complexion gave it much of an Ethiopian
aspect)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Candace is asleep now, and I may tell
you about it; only we must both speak low, lest she should waken.
This book was given me by Graham; it tells about distant countries,
a long, long way from England, which no traveller can reach without
sailing thousands of miles over the sea. Wild men live in these
countries, Miss Snowe, who wear clothes different from ours:
indeed, some of them wear scarcely any clothes, for the sake of
being cool, you know; for they have very hot weather. Here is a
picture of thousands gathered in a desolate
place&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a plain, spread with
sand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;round a man in black,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
good, <i>good</i> Englishman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a missionary, who
is preaching to them under a palm-tree." (She showed a little
coloured cut to that effect.) "And here are pictures" (she went on)
"more stranger" (grammar was occasionally forgotten) "than that.
There is the wonderful Great Wall of China; here is a Chinese lady,
with a foot littler than mine. There is a wild horse of Tartary;
and here, most strange of all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is a land of ice
and snow, without green fields, woods, or gardens. In this land,
they found some mammoth bones: there are no mammoths now. You don't
know what it was; but I can tell you, because Graham told me. A
mighty, goblin creature, as high as this room, and as long as the
hall; but not a fierce, flesh-eating thing, Graham thinks. He
believes, if I met one in a forest, it would not kill me, unless I
came quite in its way; when it would trample me down amongst the
bushes, as I might tread on a grasshopper in a hayfield without
knowing it."</p>
<p id="id00302">Thus she rambled on.</p>
<p id="id00303">"Polly," I interrupted, "should you like to
travel?"</p>
<p id="id00304">"Not just yet," was the prudent answer; "but
perhaps in twenty years, when I am grown a woman, as tall as Mrs.
Bretton, I may travel with Graham. We intend going to Switzerland,
and climbing Mount Blanck; and some day we shall sail over to South
America, and walk to the top of Kim-kim-borazo."</p>
<p id="id00305">"But how would you like to travel now, if your papa
was with you?"</p>
<p id="id00306">Her reply&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not given till after a
pause&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;evinced one of those unexpected turns of
temper peculiar to her.</p>
<p id="id00307">"Where is the good of talking in that silly way?"
said she. "Why do you mention papa? What is papa to you? I was just
beginning to be happy, and not think about him so much; and there
it will be all to do over again!"</p>
<p id="id00308">Her lip trembled. I hastened to disclose the fact
of a letter having been received, and to mention the directions
given that she and Harriet should immediately rejoin this dear
papa. "Now, Polly, are you not glad?" I added.</p>
<p id="id00309">She made no answer. She dropped her book and ceased
to rock her doll; she gazed at me with gravity and earnestness.</p>
<p id="id00310">"Shall not you like to go to papa?"</p>
<p id="id00311">"Of course," she said at last in that trenchant
manner she usually employed in speaking to me; and which was quite
different from that she used with Mrs. Bretton, and different again
from the one dedicated to Graham. I wished to ascertain more of
what she thought but no: she would converse no more. Hastening to
Mrs. Bretton, she questioned her, and received the confirmation of
my news. The weight and importance of these tidings kept her
perfectly serious the whole day. In the evening, at the moment
Graham's entrance was heard below, I found her at my side. She
began to arrange a locket-ribbon about my neck, she displaced and
replaced the comb in my hair; while thus busied, Graham
entered.</p>
<p id="id00312">"Tell him by-and-by," she whispered; "tell him I am
going."</p>
<p id="id00313">In the course of tea-time I made the desired
communication. Graham, it chanced, was at that time greatly
preoccupied about some school-prize, for which he was competing.
The news had to be told twice before it took proper hold of his
attention, and even then he dwelt on it but momently.</p>
<p id="id00314">"Polly going? What a pity! Dear little Mousie, I
shall be sorry to lose her: she must come to us again, mamma."</p>
<p id="id00315">And hastily swallowing his tea, he took a candle
and a small table to himself and his books, and was soon buried in
study.</p>
<p id="id00316">"Little Mousie" crept to his side, and lay down on
the carpet at his feet, her face to the floor; mute and motionless
she kept that post and position till bed-time. Once I saw
Graham&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wholly unconscious of her
proximity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;push her with his restless foot. She
receded an inch or two. A minute after one little hand stole out
from beneath her face, to which it had been pressed, and softly
caressed the heedless foot. When summoned by her nurse she rose and
departed very obediently, having bid us all a subdued
good-night.</p>
<p id="id00317">I will not say that I dreaded going to bed, an hour
later; yet I certainly went with an unquiet anticipation that I
should find that child in no peaceful sleep. The forewarning of my
instinct was but fulfilled, when I discovered her, all cold and
vigilant, perched like a white bird on the outside of the bed. I
scarcely knew how to accost her; she was not to be managed like
another child. She, however, accosted me. As I closed the door, and
put the light on the dressing-table, she turned tome with these
words:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I
cannot&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>cannot</i> sleep; and in this way I
cannot&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>cannot</i> live!"</p>
<p id="id00318">I asked what ailed her.</p>
<p id="id00319">"Dedful miz-er-y!" said she, with her piteous
lisp.</p>
<p id="id00320">"Shall I call Mrs. Bretton?"</p>
<p id="id00321">"That is downright silly," was her impatient reply;
and, indeed, I well knew that if she had heard Mrs. Bretton's foot
approach, she would have nestled quiet as a mouse under the
bedclothes. Whilst lavishing her eccentricities regardlessly before
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for whom she professed scarcely the semblance
of affection&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she never showed my godmother one
glimpse of her inner self: for her, she was nothing but a docile,
somewhat quaint little maiden. I examined her; her cheek was
crimson; her dilated eye was both troubled and glowing, and
painfully restless: in this state it was obvious she must not be
left till morning. I guessed how the case stood.</p>
<p id="id00322">"Would you like to bid Graham good-night again?" I
asked. "He is not gone to his room yet."</p>
<p id="id00323">She at once stretched out her little arms to be
lifted. Folding a shawl round her, I carried her back to the
drawing-room. Graham was just coming out.</p>
<p id="id00324">"She cannot sleep without seeing and speaking to
you once more," I said. "She does not like the thought of leaving
you."</p>
<p id="id00325">"I've spoilt her," said he, taking her from me with
good humour, and kissing her little hot face and burning lips.
"Polly, you care for me more than for papa,
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id00326">"I <i>do</i> care for you, but you care nothing for
me," was her whisper.</p>
<p id="id00327">She was assured to the contrary, again kissed,
restored to me, and I carried her away; but, alas! not soothed.</p>
<p id="id00328">When I thought she could listen to me, I
said&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Paulina, you should not grieve that Graham
does not care for you so much as you care for him. It must be
so."</p>
<p id="id00329">Her lifted and questioning eyes asked why.</p>
<p id="id00330">"Because he is a boy and you are a girl; he is
sixteen and you are only six; his nature is strong and gay, and
yours is otherwise."</p>
<p id="id00331">"But I love him so much; he <i>should</i> love me a
little."</p>
<p id="id00332">"He does. He is fond of you. You are his
favourite."</p>
<p id="id00333">"Am I Graham's favourite?"</p>
<p id="id00334">"Yes, more than any little child I know."</p>
<p id="id00335">The assurance soothed her; she smiled in her
anguish.</p>
<p id="id00336">"But," I continued, "don't fret, and don't expect
too much of him, or else he will feel you to be troublesome, and
then it is all over."</p>
<p id="id00337">"All over!" she echoed softly; "then I'll be good.
I'll try to be good,<br />
Lucy Snowe."<br /></p>
<p id="id00338">I put her to bed.</p>
<p id="id00339">"Will he forgive me this one time?" she asked, as I
undressed myself. I assured her that he would; that as yet he was
by no means alienated; that she had only to be careful for the
future.</p>
<p id="id00340">"There is no future," said she: "I am going. Shall
I ever&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ever&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;see him again,
after I leave England?"</p>
<p id="id00341">I returned an encouraging response. The candle
being extinguished, a still half-hour elapsed. I thought her
asleep, when the little white shape once more lifted itself in the
crib, and the small voice asked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Do you like
Graham, Miss Snowe?"</p>
<p id="id00342">"Like him! Yes, a little."</p>
<p id="id00343">"Only a little! Do you like him as I do?"</p>
<p id="id00344">"I think not. No: not as you do."</p>
<p id="id00345">"Do you like him much?"</p>
<p id="id00346">"I told you I liked him a little. Where is the use
of caring for him so very much: he is full of faults."</p>
<p id="id00347">"Is he?"</p>
<p id="id00348">"All boys are."</p>
<p id="id00349">"More than girls?"</p>
<p id="id00350">"Very likely. Wise people say it is folly to think
anybody perfect; and as to likes and dislikes, we should be
friendly to all, and worship none."</p>
<p id="id00351">"Are you a wise person?"</p>
<p id="id00352">"I mean to try to be so. Go to sleep."</p>
<p id="id00353">"I <i>cannot</i> go to sleep. Have you no pain just
here" (laying her elfish hand on her elfish breast,) "when you
think <i>you</i> shall have to leave Graham; for <i>your</i> home
is not here?"</p>
<p id="id00354">"Surely, Polly," said I, "you should not feel so
much pain when you are very soon going to rejoin your father. Have
you forgotten him? Do you no longer wish to be his little
companion?"</p>
<p id="id00355">Dead silence succeeded this question.</p>
<p id="id00356">"Child, lie down and sleep," I urged.</p>
<p id="id00357">"My bed is cold," said she. "I can't warm it."</p>
<p id="id00358">I saw the little thing shiver. "Come to me," I
said, wishing, yet scarcely hoping, that she would comply: for she
was a most strange, capricious, little creature, and especially
whimsical with me. She came, however, instantly, like a small ghost
gliding over the carpet. I took her in. She was chill: I warmed her
in my arms. She trembled nervously; I soothed her. Thus
tranquillized and cherished she at last slumbered.</p>
<p id="id00359">"A very unique child," thought I, as I viewed her
sleeping countenance by the fitful moonlight, and cautiously and
softly wiped her glittering eyelids and her wet cheeks with my
handkerchief. "How will she get through this world, or battle with
this life? How will she bear the shocks and repulses, the
humiliations and desolations, which books, and my own reason, tell
me are prepared for all flesh?"</p>
<p id="id00360">She departed the next day; trembling like a leaf
when she took leave, but exercising self-command.</p>
<h2 id="id00361" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h5 id="id00362">MISS MARCHMONT.</h5>
<p id="id00363" style="margin-top: 2em">On quitting Bretton, which
I did a few weeks after Paulina's
departure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;little thinking then I was never again
to visit it; never more to tread its calm old
streets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I betook myself home, having been absent
six months. It will be conjectured that I was of course glad to
return to the bosom of my kindred. Well! the amiable conjecture
does no harm, and may therefore be safely left uncontradicted. Far
from saying nay, indeed, I will permit the reader to picture me,
for the next eight years, as a bark slumbering through halcyon
weather, in a harbour still as glass&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
steersman stretched on the little deck, his face up to heaven, his
eyes closed: buried, if you will, in a long prayer. A great many
women and girls are supposed to pass their lives something in that
fashion; why not I with the rest?</p>
<p id="id00364">Picture me then idle, basking, plump, and happy,
stretched on a cushioned deck, warmed with constant sunshine,
rocked by breezes indolently soft. However, it cannot be concealed
that, in that case, I must somehow have fallen overboard, or that
there must have been wreck at last. I too well remember a
time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a long time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of cold, of
danger, of contention. To this hour, when I have the nightmare, it
repeats the rush and saltness of briny waves in my throat, and
their icy pressure on my lungs. I even know there was a storm, and
that not of one hour nor one day. For many days and nights neither
sun nor stars appeared; we cast with our own hands the tackling out
of the ship; a heavy tempest lay on us; all hope that we should be
saved was taken away. In fine, the ship was lost, the crew
perished.</p>
<p id="id00365">As far as I recollect, I complained to no one about
these troubles. Indeed, to whom could I complain? Of Mrs. Bretton I
had long lost sight. Impediments, raised by others, had, years ago,
come in the way of our intercourse, and cut it off. Besides, time
had brought changes for her, too: the handsome property of which
she was left guardian for her son, and which had been chiefly
invested in some joint-stock undertaking, had melted, it was said,
to a fraction of its original amount. Graham, I learned from
incidental rumours, had adopted a profession; both he and his
mother were gone from Bretton, and were understood to be now in
London. Thus, there remained no possibility of dependence on
others; to myself alone could I look. I know not that I was of a
self-reliant or active nature; but self-reliance and exertion were
forced upon me by circumstances, as they are upon thousands
besides; and when Miss Marchmont, a maiden lady of our
neighbourhood, sent for me, I obeyed her behest, in the hope that
she might assign me some task I could undertake.</p>
<p id="id00366">Miss Marchmont was a woman of fortune, and lived in
a handsome residence; but she was a rheumatic cripple, impotent,
foot and hand, and had been so for twenty years. She always sat
upstairs: her drawing-room adjoined her bed-room. I had often heard
of Miss Marchmont, and of her peculiarities (she had the character
of being very eccentric), but till now had never seen her. I found
her a furrowed, grey-haired woman, grave with solitude, stern with
long affliction, irritable also, and perhaps exacting. It seemed
that a maid, or rather companion, who had waited on her for some
years, was about to be married; and she, hearing of my bereaved
lot, had sent for me, with the idea that I might supply this
person's place. She made the proposal to me after tea, as she and I
sat alone by her fireside.</p>
<p id="id00367">"It will not be an easy life;" said she candidly,
"for I require a good deal of attention, and you will be much
confined; yet, perhaps, contrasted with the existence you have
lately led, it may appear tolerable."</p>
<p id="id00368">I reflected. Of course it ought to appear
tolerable, I argued inwardly; but somehow, by some strange
fatality, it would not. To live here, in this close room, the
watcher of suffering&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sometimes, perhaps, the
butt of temper&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;through all that was to come of
my youth; while all that was gone had passed, to say the least, not
blissfully! My heart sunk one moment, then it revived; for though I
forced myself to <i>realise</i> evils, I think I was too prosaic to
<i>idealise</i>, and consequently to exaggerate them.</p>
<p id="id00369">"My doubt is whether I should have strength for the
undertaking," I observed.</p>
<p id="id00370">"That is my own scruple," said she; "for you look a
worn-out creature."</p>
<p id="id00371">So I did. I saw myself in the glass, in my
mourning-dress, a faded, hollow-eyed vision. Yet I thought little
of the wan spectacle. The blight, I believed, was chiefly external:
I still felt life at life's sources.</p>
<p id="id00372">"What else have you in
view&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;anything?"</p>
<p id="id00373">"Nothing clear as yet: but I may find
something."</p>
<p id="id00374">"So you imagine: perhaps you are right. Try your
own method, then; and if it does not succeed, test mine. The chance
I have offered shall be left open to you for three months."</p>
<p id="id00375">This was kind. I told her so, and expressed my
gratitude. While I was speaking, a paroxysm of pain came on. I
ministered to her; made the necessary applications, according to
her directions, and, by the time she was relieved, a sort of
intimacy was already formed between us. I, for my part, had learned
from the manner in which she bore this attack, that she was a firm,
patient woman (patient under physical pain, though sometimes
perhaps excitable under long mental canker); and she, from the
good-will with which I succoured her, discovered that she could
influence my sympathies (such as they were). She sent for me the
next day; for five or six successive days she claimed my company.
Closer acquaintance, while it developed both faults and
eccentricities, opened, at the same time, a view of a character I
could respect. Stern and even morose as she sometimes was, I could
wait on her and sit beside her with that calm which always blesses
us when we are sensible that our manners, presence, contact, please
and soothe the persons we serve. Even when she scolded
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which she did, now and then, very
tartly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it was in such a way as did not
humiliate, and left no sting; it was rather like an irascible
mother rating her daughter, than a harsh mistress lecturing a
dependant: lecture, indeed, she could not, though she could
occasionally storm. Moreover, a vein of reason ever ran through her
passion: she was logical even when fierce. Ere long a growing sense
of attachment began to present the thought of staying with her as
companion in quite a new light; in another week I had agreed to
remain.</p>
<p id="id00376">Two hot, close rooms thus became my world; and a
crippled old woman, my mistress, my friend, my all. Her service was
my duty&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her pain, my
suffering&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her relief, my
hope&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her anger, my
punishment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her regard, my reward. I forgot that
there were fields, woods, rivers, seas, an ever-changing sky
outside the steam-dimmed lattice of this sick chamber; I was almost
content to forget it. All within me became narrowed to my lot. Tame
and still by habit, disciplined by destiny, I demanded no walks in
the fresh air; my appetite needed no more than the tiny messes
served for the invalid. In addition, she gave me the originality of
her character to study: the steadiness of her virtues, I will add,
the power of her passions, to admire; the truth of her feelings to
trust. All these things she had, and for these things I clung to
her.</p>
<p id="id00377">For these things I would have crawled on with her
for twenty years, if for twenty years longer her life of endurance
had been protracted. But another decree was written. It seemed I
must be stimulated into action. I must be goaded, driven, stung,
forced to energy. My little morsel of human affection, which I
prized as if it were a solid pearl, must melt in my fingers and
slip thence like a dissolving hailstone. My small adopted duty must
be snatched from my easily contented conscience. I had wanted to
compromise with Fate: to escape occasional great agonies by
submitting to a whole life of privation and small pains. Fate would
not so be pacified; nor would Providence sanction this shrinking
sloth and cowardly indolence.</p>
<p id="id00378">One February night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I remember it
well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there came a voice near Miss Marchmont's
house, heard by every inmate, but translated, perhaps, only by one.
After a calm winter, storms were ushering in the spring. I had put
Miss Marchmont to bed; I sat at the fireside sewing. The wind was
wailing at the windows; it had wailed all day; but, as night
deepened, it took a new tone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an accent keen,
piercing, almost articulate to the ear; a plaint, piteous and
disconsolate to the nerves, trilled in every gust.</p>
<p id="id00379">"Oh, hush! hush!" I said in my disturbed mind,
dropping my work, and making a vain effort to stop my ears against
that subtle, searching cry. I had heard that very voice ere this,
and compulsory observation had forced on me a theory as to what it
boded. Three times in the course of my life, events had taught me
that these strange accents in the storm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this
restless, hopeless cry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;denote a coming state of
the atmosphere unpropitious to life. Epidemic diseases, I believed,
were often heralded by a gasping, sobbing, tormented,
long-lamenting east wind. Hence, I inferred, arose the legend of
the Banshee. I fancied, too, I had noticed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but
was not philosopher enough to know whether there was any connection
between the circumstances&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that we often at the
same time hear of disturbed volcanic action in distant parts of the
world; of rivers suddenly rushing above their banks; and of strange
high tides flowing furiously in on low sea-coasts. "Our globe," I
had said to myself, "seems at such periods torn and disordered; the
feeble amongst us wither in her distempered breath, rushing hot
from steaming volcanoes."</p>
<p id="id00380">I listened and trembled; Miss Marchmont slept.</p>
<p id="id00381">About midnight, the storm in one half-hour fell to
a dead calm. The fire, which had been burning dead, glowed up
vividly. I felt the air change, and become keen. Raising blind and
curtain, I looked out, and saw in the stars the keen sparkle of a
sharp frost.</p>
<p id="id00382">Turning away, the object that met my eyes was Miss
Marchmont awake, lifting her head from the pillow, and regarding me
with unusual earnestness.</p>
<p id="id00383">"Is it a fine night?" she asked.</p>
<p id="id00384">I replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p id="id00385">"I thought so," she said; "for I feel so strong, so
well. Raise me. I feel young to-night," she continued: "young,
light-hearted, and happy. What if my complaint be about to take a
turn, and I am yet destined to enjoy health? It would be a
miracle!"</p>
<p id="id00386">"And these are not the days of miracles," I thought
to myself, and wondered to hear her talk so. She went on directing
her conversation to the past, and seeming to recall its incidents,
scenes, and personages, with singular vividness.</p>
<p id="id00387">"I love Memory to-night," she said: "I prize her as
my best friend. She is just now giving me a deep delight: she is
bringing back to my heart, in warm and beautiful life,
realities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not mere empty ideas, but what were
once realities, and that I long have thought decayed, dissolved,
mixed in with grave-mould. I possess just now the hours, the
thoughts, the hopes of my youth. I renew the love of my
life&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;its only love&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost its
only affection; for I am not a particularly good woman: I am not
amiable. Yet I have had my feelings, strong and concentrated; and
these feelings had their object; which, in its single self, was
dear to me, as to the majority of men and women, are all the
unnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard. While I
loved, and while I was loved, what an existence I enjoyed! What a
glorious year I can recall&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how bright it comes
back to me! What a living spring&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what a warm,
glad summer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what soft moonlight, silvering the
autumn evenings&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what strength of hope under the
ice-bound waters and frost-hoar fields of that year's winter!
Through that year my heart lived with Frank's heart. O my noble
Frank&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my faithful Frank&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my
<i>good</i> Frank! so much better than
myself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his standard in all things so much
higher! This I can now see and say: if few women have suffered as I
did in his loss, few have enjoyed what I did in his love. It was a
far better kind of love than common; I had no doubts about it or
him: it was such a love as honoured, protected, and elevated, no
less than it gladdened her to whom it was given. Let me now ask,
just at this moment, when my mind is so strangely
clear,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;let me reflect why it was taken from me?
For what crime was I condemned, after twelve months of bliss, to
undergo thirty years of sorrow?</p>
<p id="id00388">"I do not know," she continued after a pause: "I
cannot&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>cannot</i> see the reason; yet at this
hour I can say with sincerity, what I never tried to say before,
Inscrutable God, Thy will be done! And at this moment I can believe
that death will restore me to Frank. I never believed it till
now."</p>
<p id="id00389">"He is dead, then?" I inquired in a low voice.</p>
<p id="id00390">"My dear girl," she said, "one happy Christmas Eve
I dressed and decorated myself, expecting my lover, very soon to be
my husband, would come that night to visit me. I sat down to wait.
Once more I see that moment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I see the snow
twilight stealing through the window over which the curtain was not
dropped, for I designed to watch him ride up the white walk; I see
and feel the soft firelight warming me, playing on my silk dress,
and fitfully showing me my own young figure in a glass. I see the
moon of a calm winter night, float full, clear, and cold, over the
inky mass of shrubbery, and the silvered turf of my grounds. I
wait, with some impatience in my pulse, but no doubt in my breast.
The flames had died in the fire, but it was a bright mass yet; the
moon was mounting high, but she was still visible from the lattice;
the clock neared ten; he rarely tarried later than this, but once
or twice he had been delayed so long.</p>
<p id="id00391">"Would he for once fail me?
No&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not even for once; and now he was
coming&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and coming fast-to atone for lost time.
'Frank! you furious rider,' I said inwardly, listening gladly, yet
anxiously, to his approaching gallop, 'you shall be rebuked for
this: I will tell you it is <i>my</i> neck you are putting in
peril; for whatever is yours is, in a dearer and tenderer sense,
mine.' There he was: I saw him; but I think tears were in my eyes,
my sight was so confused. I saw the horse; I heard it
stamp&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I saw at least a mass; I heard a clamour.
<i>Was</i> it a horse? or what heavy, dragging thing was it,
crossing, strangely dark, the lawn. How could I name that thing in
the moonlight before me? or how could I utter the feeling which
rose in my soul?</p>
<p id="id00392">"I could only run out. A great
animal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;truly, Frank's black
horse&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stood trembling, panting, snorting before
the door; a man held it Frank, as I thought.</p>
<p id="id00393">"'What is the matter?' I demanded. Thomas, my own
servant, answered by saying sharply, 'Go into the house, madam.'
And then calling to another servant, who came hurrying from the
kitchen as if summoned by some instinct, 'Ruth, take missis into
the house directly.' But I was kneeling down in the snow, beside
something that lay there&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something that I had
seen dragged along the ground&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something that
sighed, that groaned on my breast, as I lifted and drew it to me.
He was not dead; he was not quite unconscious. I had him carried
in; I refused to be ordered about and thrust from him. I was quite
collected enough, not only to be my own mistress but the mistress
of others. They had begun by trying to treat me like a child, as
they always do with people struck by God's hand; but I gave place
to none except the surgeon; and when he had done what he could, I
took my dying Frank to myself. He had strength to fold me in his
arms; he had power to speak my name; he heard me as I prayed over
him very softly; he felt me as I tenderly and fondly comforted
him.</p>
<p id="id00394">"'Maria,' he said, 'I am dying in Paradise.' He
spent his last breath in faithful words for me. When the dawn of
Christmas morning broke, my Frank was with God.</p>
<p id="id00395">"And that," she went on, "happened thirty years
ago. I have suffered since. I doubt if I have made the best use of
all my calamities. Soft, amiable natures they would have refined to
saintliness; of strong, evil spirits they would have made demons;
as for me, I have only been a woe-struck and selfish woman."</p>
<p id="id00396">"You have done much good," I said; for she was
noted for her liberal almsgiving.</p>
<p id="id00397">"I have not withheld money, you mean, where it
could assuage affliction. What of that? It cost me no effort or
pang to give. But I think from this day I am about to enter a
better frame of mind, to prepare myself for reunion with Frank. You
see I still think of Frank more than of God; and unless it be
counted that in thus loving the creature so much, so long, and so
exclusively, I have not at least blasphemed the Creator, small is
my chance of salvation. What do you think, Lucy, of these things?
Be my chaplain, and tell me."</p>
<p id="id00398">This question I could not answer: I had no words.
It seemed as if she thought I <i>had</i> answered it.</p>
<p id="id00399">"Very right, my child. We should acknowledge God
merciful, but not always for us comprehensible. We should accept
our own lot, whatever it be, and try to render happy that of
others. Should we not? Well, to-morrow I will begin by trying to
make you happy. I will endeavour to do something for you, Lucy:
something that will benefit you when I am dead. My head aches now
with talking too much; still I am happy. Go to bed. The clock
strikes two. How late you sit up; or rather how late I, in my
selfishness, keep you up. But go now; have no more anxiety for me;
I feel I shall rest well."</p>
<p id="id00400">She composed herself as if to slumber. I, too,
retired to my crib in a closet within her room. The night passed in
quietness; quietly her doom must at last have come: peacefully and
painlessly: in the morning she was found without life, nearly cold,
but all calm and undisturbed. Her previous excitement of spirits
and change of mood had been the prelude of a fit; one stroke
sufficed to sever the thread of an existence so long fretted by
affliction.</p>
<h2 id="id00401" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h5 id="id00402">TURNING A NEW LEAF.</h5>
<p id="id00403" style="margin-top: 2em">My mistress being dead, and
I once more alone, I had to look out for a new place. About this
time I might be a little&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a very
little&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shaken in nerves. I grant I was not
looking well, but, on the contrary, thin, haggard, and hollow-eyed;
like a sitter-up at night, like an overwrought servant, or a
placeless person in debt. In debt, however, I was not; nor quite
poor; for though Miss Marchmont had not had time to benefit me, as,
on that last night, she said she intended, yet, after the funeral,
my wages were duly paid by her second cousin, the heir, an
avaricious-looking man, with pinched nose and narrow temples, who,
indeed, I heard long afterwards, turned out a thorough miser: a
direct contrast to his generous kinswoman, and a foil to her
memory, blessed to this day by the poor and needy. The possessor,
then, of fifteen pounds; of health, though worn, not broken, and of
a spirit in similar condition; I might still; in comparison with
many people, be regarded as occupying an enviable position. An
embarrassing one it was, however, at the same time; as I felt with
some acuteness on a certain day, of which the corresponding one in
the next week was to see my departure from my present abode, while
with another I was not provided.</p>
<p id="id00404">In this dilemma I went, as a last and sole
resource, to see and consult an old servant of our family; once my
nurse, now housekeeper at a grand mansion not far from Miss
Marchmont's. I spent some hours with her; she comforted, but knew
not how to advise me. Still all inward darkness, I left her about
twilight; a walk of two miles lay before me; it was a clear, frosty
night. In spite of my solitude, my poverty, and my perplexity, my
heart, nourished and nerved with the vigour of a youth that had not
yet counted twenty-three summers, beat light and not feebly. Not
feebly, I am sure, or I should have trembled in that lonely walk,
which lay through still fields, and passed neither village nor
farmhouse, nor cottage: I should have quailed in the absence of
moonlight, for it was by the leading of stars only I traced the dim
path; I should have quailed still more in the unwonted presence of
that which to-night shone in the north, a moving
mystery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the Aurora Borealis. But this solemn
stranger influenced me otherwise than through my fears. Some new
power it seemed to bring. I drew in energy with the keen, low
breeze that blew on its path. A bold thought was sent to my mind;
my mind was made strong to receive it.</p>
<p id="id00405">"Leave this wilderness," it was said to me, "and go
out hence."</p>
<p id="id00406">"Where?" was the query.</p>
<p id="id00407">I had not very far to look; gazing from this
country parish in that flat, rich middle of
England&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I mentally saw within reach what I had
never yet beheld with my bodily eyes: I saw London.</p>
<p id="id00408">The next day I returned to the hall, and asking
once more to see the housekeeper, I communicated to her my
plan.</p>
<p id="id00409">Mrs. Barrett was a grave, judicious woman, though
she knew little more of the world than myself; but grave and
judicious as she was, she did not charge me with being out of my
senses; and, indeed, I had a staid manner of my own which ere now
had been as good to me as cloak and hood of hodden grey, since
under its favour I had been enabled to achieve with impunity, and
even approbation, deeds that, if attempted with an excited and
unsettled air, would in some minds have stamped me as a dreamer and
zealot.</p>
<p id="id00410">The housekeeper was slowly propounding some
difficulties, while she prepared orange-rind for marmalade, when a
child ran past the window and came bounding into the room. It was a
pretty child, and as it danced, laughing, up to
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for we were not strangers (nor, indeed, was
its mother&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a young married daughter of the
house&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a stranger)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I took it
on my knee.</p>
<p id="id00411">Different as were our social positions now, this
child's mother and I had been schoolfellows, when I was a girl of
ten and she a young lady of sixteen; and I remembered her,
good-looking, but dull, in a lower class than mine.</p>
<p id="id00412">I was admiring the boy's handsome dark eyes, when
the mother, young Mrs. Leigh, entered. What a beautiful and
kind-looking woman was the good-natured and comely, but
unintellectual, girl become! Wifehood and maternity had changed her
thus, as I have since seen them change others even less promising
than she. Me she had forgotten. I was changed too, though not, I
fear, for the better. I made no attempt to recall myself to her
memory; why should I? She came for her son to accompany her in a
walk, and behind her followed a nurse, carrying an infant. I only
mention the incident because, in addressing the nurse, Mrs. Leigh
spoke French (very bad French, by the way, and with an incorrigibly
bad accent, again forcibly reminding me of our school-days): and I
found the woman was a foreigner. The little boy chattered volubly
in French too. When the whole party were withdrawn, Mrs. Barrett
remarked that her young lady had brought that foreign nurse home
with her two years ago, on her return from a Continental excursion;
that she was treated almost as well as a governess, and had nothing
to do but walk out with the baby and chatter French with Master
Charles; "and," added Mrs. Barrett, "she says there are many
Englishwomen in foreign families as well placed as she."</p>
<p id="id00413">I stored up this piece of casual information, as
careful housewives store seemingly worthless shreds and fragments
for which their prescient minds anticipate a possible use some day.
Before I left my old friend, she gave me the address of a
respectable old-fashioned inn in the City, which, she said, my
uncles used to frequent in former days.</p>
<p id="id00414">In going to London, I ran less risk and evinced
less enterprise than the reader may think. In fact, the distance
was only fifty miles. My means would suffice both to take me there,
to keep me a few days, and also to bring me back if I found no
inducement to stay. I regarded it as a brief holiday, permitted for
once to work-weary faculties, rather than as an adventure of life
and death. There is nothing like taking all you do at a moderate
estimate: it keeps mind and body tranquil; whereas grandiloquent
notions are apt to hurry both into fever.</p>
<p id="id00415">Fifty miles were then a day's journey (for I speak
of a time gone by: my hair, which, till a late period, withstood
the frosts of time, lies now, at last white, under a white cap,
like snow beneath snow). About nine o'clock of a wet February night
I reached London.</p>
<p id="id00416">My reader, I know, is one who would not thank me
for an elaborate reproduction of poetic first impressions; and it
is well, inasmuch as I had neither time nor mood to cherish such;
arriving as I did late, on a dark, raw, and rainy evening, in a
Babylon and a wilderness, of which the vastness and the strangeness
tried to the utmost any powers of clear thought and steady
self-possession with which, in the absence of more brilliant
faculties, Nature might have gifted me.</p>
<p id="id00417">When I left the coach, the strange speech of the
cabmen and others waiting round, seemed to me odd as a foreign
tongue. I had never before heard the English language chopped up in
that way. However, I managed to understand and to be understood, so
far as to get myself and trunk safely conveyed to the old inn
whereof I had the address. How difficult, how oppressive, how
puzzling seemed my flight! In London for the first time; at an inn
for the first time; tired with travelling; confused with darkness;
palsied with cold; unfurnished with either experience or advice to
tell me how to act, and yet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to act obliged.</p>
<p id="id00418">Into the hands of common sense I confided the
matter. Common sense, however, was as chilled and bewildered as all
my other faculties, and it was only under the spur of an inexorable
necessity that she spasmodically executed her trust. Thus urged,
she paid the porter: considering the crisis, I did not blame her
too much that she was hugely cheated; she asked the waiter for a
room; she timorously called for the chambermaid; what is far more,
she bore, without being wholly overcome, a highly supercilious
style of demeanour from that young lady, when she appeared.</p>
<p id="id00419">I recollect this same chambermaid was a pattern of
town prettiness and smartness. So trim her waist, her cap, her
dress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I wondered how they had all been
manufactured. Her speech had an accent which in its mincing
glibness seemed to rebuke mine as by authority; her spruce attire
flaunted an easy scorn to my plain country garb.</p>
<p id="id00420">"Well, it can't be helped," I thought, "and then
the scene is new, and the circumstances; I shall gain good."</p>
<p id="id00421">Maintaining a very quiet manner towards this
arrogant little maid, and subsequently observing the same towards
the parsonic-looking, black-coated, white-neckclothed waiter, I got
civility from them ere long. I believe at first they thought I was
a servant; but in a little while they changed their minds, and
hovered in a doubtful state between patronage and politeness.</p>
<p id="id00422">I kept up well till I had partaken of some
refreshment, warmed myself by a fire, and was fairly shut into my
own room; but, as I sat down by the bed and rested my head and arms
on the pillow, a terrible oppression overcame me. All at once my
position rose on me like a ghost. Anomalous, desolate, almost blank
of hope it stood. What was I doing here alone in great London? What
should I do on the morrow? What prospects had I in life? What
friends had I on, earth? Whence did I come? Whither should I go?
What should I do?</p>
<p id="id00423">I wet the pillow, my arms, and my hair, with
rushing tears. A dark interval of most bitter thought followed this
burst; but I did not regret the step taken, nor wish to retract it
A strong, vague persuasion that it was better to go forward than
backward, and that I <i>could</i> go
forward&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that a way, however narrow and
difficult, would in time open&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;predominated over
other feelings: its influence hushed them so far, that at last I
became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say my prayers and seek
my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and lain down, when a
deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At first I knew it
not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the twelfth colossal
hum and trembling knell, I said: "I lie in the shadow of St.
Paul's."</p>
<h2 id="id00424" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h5 id="id00425">LONDON.</h5>
<p id="id00426" style="margin-top: 2em">The next day was the first
of March, and when I awoke, rose, and opened my curtain, I saw the
risen sun struggling through fog. Above my head, above the
house-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds, I saw a solemn,
orbed mass, dark blue and dim&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;THE DOME. While I
looked, my inner self moved; my spirit shook its always-fettered
wings half loose; I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet
truly lived, were at last about to taste life. In that morning my
soul grew as fast as Jonah's gourd.</p>
<p id="id00427">"I did well to come," I said, proceeding to dress
with speed and care. "I like the spirit of this great London which
I feel around me. Who but a coward would pass his whole life in
hamlets; and for ever abandon his faculties to the eating rust of
obscurity?"</p>
<p id="id00428">Being dressed, I went down; not travel-worn and
exhausted, but tidy and refreshed. When the waiter came in with my
breakfast, I managed to accost him sedately, yet cheerfully; we had
ten minutes' discourse, in the course of which we became usefully
known to each other.</p>
<p id="id00429">He was a grey-haired, elderly man; and, it seemed,
had lived in his present place twenty years. Having ascertained
this, I was sure he must remember my two uncles, Charles and
Wilmot, who, fifteen, years ago, were frequent visitors here. I
mentioned their names; he recalled them perfectly, and with
respect. Having intimated my connection, my position in his eyes
was henceforth clear, and on a right footing. He said I was like my
uncle Charles: I suppose he spoke truth, because Mrs. Barrett was
accustomed to say the same thing. A ready and obliging courtesy now
replaced his former uncomfortably doubtful manner; henceforth I
need no longer be at a loss for a civil answer to a sensible
question.</p>
<p id="id00430">The street on which my little sitting-room window
looked was narrow, perfectly quiet, and not dirty: the few
passengers were just such as one sees in provincial towns: here was
nothing formidable; I felt sure I might venture out alone.</p>
<p id="id00431">Having breakfasted, out I went. Elation and
pleasure were in my heart: to walk alone in London seemed of itself
an adventure. Presently I found myself in Paternoster
Row&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;classic ground this. I entered a
bookseller's shop, kept by one Jones: I bought a little
book&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a piece of extravagance I could ill afford;
but I thought I would one day give or send it to Mrs. Barrett. Mr.
Jones, a dried-in man of business, stood behind his desk: he seemed
one of the greatest, and I one of the happiest of beings.</p>
<p id="id00432">Prodigious was the amount of life I lived that
morning. Finding myself before St. Paul's, I went in; I mounted to
the dome: I saw thence London, with its river, and its bridges, and
its churches; I saw antique Westminster, and the green Temple
Gardens, with sun upon them, and a glad, blue sky, of early spring
above; and between them and it, not too dense, a cloud of haze.</p>
<p id="id00433">Descending, I went wandering whither chance might
lead, in a still ecstasy of freedom and enjoyment; and I
got&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I know not how&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I got into
the heart of city life. I saw and felt London at last: I got into
the Strand; I went up Cornhill; I mixed with the life passing
along; I dared the perils of crossings. To do this, and to do it
utterly alone, gave me, perhaps an irrational, but a real pleasure.
Since those days, I have seen the West End, the parks, the fine
squares; but I love the city far better. The city seems so much
more in earnest: its business, its rush, its roar, are such serious
things, sights, and sounds. The city is getting its
living&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the West End but enjoying its pleasure.
At the West End you may be amused, but in the city you are deeply
excited.</p>
<p id="id00434">Faint, at last, and hungry (it was years since I
had felt such healthy hunger), I returned, about two o'clock, to my
dark, old, and quiet inn. I dined on two
dishes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a plain joint and vegetables; both seemed
excellent: how much better than the small, dainty messes Miss
Marchmont's cook used to send up to my kind, dead mistress and me,
and to the discussion of which we could not bring half an appetite
between us! Delightfully tired, I lay down, on three chairs for an
hour (the room did not boast a sofa). I slept, then I woke and
thought for two hours.</p>
<p id="id00435">My state of mind, and all accompanying
circumstances, were just now such as most to favour the adoption of
a new, resolute, and daring&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps
desperate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;line of action. I had nothing to lose.
Unutterable loathing of a desolate existence past, forbade return.
If I failed in what I now designed to undertake, who, save myself,
would suffer? If I died far away from&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;home, I
was going to say, but I had no home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;from
England, then, who would weep?</p>
<p id="id00436">I might suffer; I was inured to suffering: death
itself had not, I thought, those terrors for me which it has for
the softly reared. I had, ere this, looked on the thought of death
with a quiet eye. Prepared, then, for any consequences, I formed a
project.</p>
<p id="id00437">That same evening I obtained from my friend, the
waiter, information respecting, the sailing of vessels for a
certain continental port, Boue-Marine. No time, I found, was to be
lost: that very night I must take my berth. I might, indeed, have
waited till the morning before going on board, but would not run
the risk of being too late.</p>
<p id="id00438">"Better take your berth at once, ma'am," counselled
the waiter. I agreed with him, and having discharged my bill, and
acknowledged my friend's services at a rate which I now know was
princely, and which in his eyes must have seemed
absurd&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and indeed, while pocketing the cash, he
smiled a faint smile which intimated his opinion of the donor's
<i>savoir-faire</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he proceeded to call a
coach. To the driver he also recommended me, giving at the same
time an injunction about taking me, I think, to the wharf, and not
leaving me to the watermen; which that functionary promised to
observe, but failed in keeping his promise: on the contrary, he
offered me up as an oblation, served me as a dripping roast, making
me alight in the midst of a throng of watermen.</p>
<p id="id00439">This was an uncomfortable crisis. It was a dark
night. The coachman instantly drove off as soon as he had got his
fare: the watermen commenced a struggle for me and my trunk. Their
oaths I hear at this moment: they shook my philosophy more than did
the night, or the isolation, or the strangeness of the scene. One
laid hands on my trunk. I looked on and waited quietly; but when
another laid hands on me, I spoke up, shook off his touch, stepped
at once into a boat, desired austerely that the trunk should be
placed beside me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Just
there,"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which was instantly done; for the owner
of the boat I had chosen became now an ally: I was rowed off.</p>
<p id="id00440">Black was the river as a torrent of ink; lights
glanced on it from the piles of building round, ships rocked on its
bosom. They rowed me up to several vessels; I read by lantern-light
their names painted in great white letters on a dark ground. "The
Ocean," "The Phoenix," "The Consort," "The Dolphin," were passed in
turns; but "The Vivid" was my ship, and it seemed she lay further
down.</p>
<p id="id00441">Down the sable flood we glided, I thought of the
Styx, and of Charon rowing some solitary soul to the Land of
Shades. Amidst the strange scene, with a chilly wind blowing in my
face and midnight clouds dropping rain above my head; with two rude
rowers for companions, whose insane oaths still tortured my ear, I
asked myself if I was wretched or terrified. I was neither. Often
in my life have I been far more so under comparatively safe
circumstances. "How is this?" said I. "Methinks I am animated and
alert, instead of being depressed and apprehensive?" I could not
tell how it was.</p>
<p id="id00442">"THE VIVID" started out, white and glaring, from
the black night at last.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Here you are!" said
the waterman, and instantly demanded six shillings.</p>
<p id="id00443">"You ask too much," I said. He drew off from the
vessel and swore he would not embark me till I paid it. A young
man, the steward as I found afterwards, was looking over the ship's
side; he grinned a smile in anticipation of the coming contest; to
disappoint him, I paid the money. Three times that afternoon I had
given crowns where I should have given shillings; but I consoled
myself with the reflection, "It is the price of experience."</p>
<p id="id00444">"They've cheated you!" said the steward exultingly
when I got on board.<br />
I answered phlegmatically that "I knew it," and went
below.<br /></p>
<p id="id00445">A stout, handsome, and showy woman was in the
ladies' cabin. I asked to be shown my berth; she looked hard at me,
muttered something about its being unusual for passengers to come
on board at that hour, and seemed disposed to be less than civil.
What a face she had&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so
comely&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so insolent and so selfish!</p>
<p id="id00446">"Now that I am on board, I shall certainly stay
here," was my answer.<br />
"I will trouble you to show me my berth."<br /></p>
<p id="id00447">She complied, but sullenly. I took off my bonnet,
arranged my things, and lay down. Some difficulties had been passed
through; a sort of victory was won: my homeless, anchorless,
unsupported mind had again leisure for a brief repose. Till the
"Vivid" arrived in harbour, no further action would be required of
me; but then&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. Oh! I could not look forward.
Harassed, exhausted, I lay in a half-trance.</p>
<p id="id00448">The stewardess talked all night; not to me but to
the young steward, her son and her very picture. He passed in and
out of the cabin continually: they disputed, they quarrelled, they
made it up again twenty times in the course of the night. She
professed to be writing a letter home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she said
to her father; she read passages of it aloud, heeding me no more
than a stock&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps she believed me asleep.
Several of these passages appeared to comprise family secrets, and
bore special reference to one "Charlotte," a younger sister who,
from the bearing of the epistle, seemed to be on the brink of
perpetrating a romantic and imprudent match; loud was the protest
of this elder lady against the distasteful union. The dutiful son
laughed his mother's correspondence to scorn. She defended it, and
raved at him. They were a strange pair. She might be thirty-nine or
forty, and was buxom and blooming as a girl of twenty. Hard, loud,
vain and vulgar, her mind and body alike seemed brazen and
imperishable. I should think, from her childhood, she must have
lived in public stations; and in her youth might very likely have
been a barmaid.</p>
<p id="id00449">Towards morning her discourse ran on a new theme:
"the Watsons," a certain expected family-party of passengers, known
to her, it appeared, and by her much esteemed on account of the
handsome profit realized in their fees. She said, "It was as good
as a little fortune to her whenever this family crossed."</p>
<p id="id00450">At dawn all were astir, and by sunrise the
passengers came on board. Boisterous was the welcome given by the
stewardess to the "Watsons," and great was the bustle made in their
honour. They were four in number, two males and two females.
Besides them, there was but one other
passenger&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a young lady, whom a gentlemanly,
though languid-looking man escorted. The two groups offered a
marked contrast. The Watsons were doubtless rich people, for they
had the confidence of conscious wealth in their bearing; the
women&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;youthful both of them, and one perfectly
handsome, as far as physical beauty went&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were
dressed richly, gaily, and absurdly out of character for the
circumstances. Their bonnets with bright flowers, their velvet
cloaks and silk dresses, seemed better suited for park or promenade
than for a damp packet deck. The men were of low stature, plain,
fat, and vulgar; the oldest, plainest, greasiest, broadest, I soon
found was the husband&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the bridegroom I suppose,
for she was very young&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of the beautiful girl.
Deep was my amazement at this discovery; and deeper still when I
perceived that, instead of being desperately wretched in such a
union, she was gay even to giddiness. "Her laughter," I reflected,
"must be the mere frenzy of despair." And even while this thought
was crossing my mind, as I stood leaning quiet and solitary against
the ship's side, she came tripping up to me, an utter stranger,
with a camp-stool in her hand, and smiling a smile of which the
levity puzzled and startled me, though it showed a perfect set of
perfect teeth, she offered me the accommodation of this piece of
furniture. I declined it of course, with all the courtesy I could
put into my manner; she danced off heedless and lightsome. She must
have been good-natured; but what had made her marry that
individual, who was at least as much like an oil-barrel as a
man?</p>
<p id="id00451">The other lady passenger, with the
gentleman-companion, was quite a girl, pretty and fair: her simple
print dress, untrimmed straw-bonnet and large shawl, gracefully
worn, formed a costume plain to quakerism: yet, for her, becoming
enough. Before the gentleman quitted her, I observed him throwing a
glance of scrutiny over all the passengers, as if to ascertain in
what company his charge would be left. With a most dissatisfied air
did his eye turn from the ladies with the gay flowers; he looked at
me, and then he spoke to his daughter, niece, or whatever she was:
she also glanced in my direction, and slightly curled her short,
pretty lip. It might be myself, or it might be my homely mourning
habit, that elicited this mark of contempt; more likely, both. A
bell rang; her father (I afterwards knew that it was her father)
kissed her, and returned to land. The packet sailed.</p>
<p id="id00452">Foreigners say that it is only English girls who
can thus be trusted to travel alone, and deep is their wonder at
the daring confidence of English parents and guardians. As for the
"jeunes Meess," by some their intrepidity is pronounced masculine
and "inconvenant," others regard them as the passive victims of an
educational and theological system which wantonly dispenses with
proper "surveillance." Whether this particular young lady was of
the sort that can the most safely be left unwatched, I do not know:
or, rather did not <i>then</i> know; but it soon appeared that the
dignity of solitude was not to her taste. She paced the deck once
or twice backwards and forwards; she looked with a little sour air
of disdain at the flaunting silks and velvets, and the bears which
thereon danced attendance, and eventually she approached me and
spoke.</p>
<p id="id00453">"Are you fond of a sea-voyage?" was her
question.</p>
<p id="id00454">I explained that my <i>fondness</i> for a
sea-voyage had yet to undergo the test of experience; I had never
made one.</p>
<p id="id00455">"Oh, how charming!" cried she. "I quite envy you
the novelty: first impressions, you know, are so pleasant. Now I
have made so many, I quite forget the first: I am quite
<i>blas&Atilde;&copy;e</i> about the sea and all that."</p>
<p id="id00456">I could not help smiling.</p>
<p id="id00457">"Why do you laugh at me?" she inquired, with a
frank testiness that pleased me better than her other talk.</p>
<p id="id00458">"Because you are so young to be
<i>blas&Atilde;&copy;e</i> about anything."</p>
<p id="id00459">"I am seventeen" (a little piqued).</p>
<p id="id00460">"You hardly look sixteen. Do you like travelling
alone?"</p>
<p id="id00461">"Bah! I care nothing about it. I have crossed the
Channel ten times, alone; but then I take care never to be long
alone: I always make friends."</p>
<p id="id00462">"You will scarcely make many friends this voyage, I
think" (glancing at the Watson-group, who were now laughing and
making a great deal of noise on deck).</p>
<p id="id00463">"Not of those odious men and women," said she:
"such people should be steerage passengers. Are you going to
school?"</p>
<p id="id00464">"No."</p>
<p id="id00465">"Where are you going?"</p>
<p id="id00466">"I have not the least
idea&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;beyond, at least, the port of
Boue-Marine."</p>
<p id="id00467">She stared, then carelessly ran on:</p>
<p id="id00468">"I am going to school. Oh, the number of foreign
schools I have been at in my life! And yet I am quite an ignoramus.
I know nothing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing in the
world&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I assure you; except that I play and dance
beautifully,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and French and German of course I
know, to speak; but I can't read or write them very well. Do you
know they wanted me to translate a page of an easy German book into
English the other day, and I couldn't do it. Papa was so mortified:
he says it looks as if M. de Bassompierre&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my
godpapa, who pays all my school-bills&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had thrown
away all his money. And then, in matters of
information&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in history, geography, arithmetic,
and so on, I am quite a baby; and I write English so
badly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such spelling and grammar, they tell me.
Into the bargain I have quite forgotten my religion; they call me a
Protestant, you know, but really I am not sure whether I am one or
not: I don't well know the difference between Romanism and
Protestantism. However, I don't in the least care for that. I was a
Lutheran once at Bonn&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dear
Bonn!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;charming Bonn!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where
there were so many handsome students. Every nice girl in our school
had an admirer; they knew our hours for walking out, and almost
always passed us on the promenade: 'Sch&Atilde;&para;nes
M&Atilde;&curren;dchen,' we used to hear them say. I was
excessively happy at Bonn!"</p>
<p id="id00469">"And where are you now?" I inquired.</p>
<p id="id00470">"Oh! at&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>chose</i>," said
she.</p>
<p id="id00471">Now, Miss Ginevra Fanshawe (such was this young
person's name) only substituted this word "<i>chose</i>" in
temporary oblivion of the real name. It was a habit she had:
"<i>chose</i>" came in at every turn in her
conversation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the convenient substitute for any
missing word in any language she might chance at the time to be
speaking. French girls often do the like; from them she had caught
the custom. "<i>Chose</i>," however, I found in this instance,
stood for Villette&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the great capital of the
great kingdom of Labassecour.</p>
<p id="id00472">"Do you like Villette?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id00473">"Pretty well. The natives, you know, are intensely
stupid and vulgar; but there are some nice English families."</p>
<p id="id00474">"Are you in a school?"</p>
<p id="id00475">"Yes."</p>
<p id="id00476">"A good one?"</p>
<p id="id00477">"Oh, no! horrid: but I go out every Sunday, and
care nothing about the <i>ma&Atilde;&reg;tresses</i> or the
<i>professeurs</i>, or the <i>&Atilde;&copy;l&Atilde;&uml;ves</i>,
and send lessons <i>au diable</i> (one daren't say that in English,
you know, but it sounds quite right in French); and thus I get on
charmingly&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. You are laughing at me again?"</p>
<p id="id00478">"No&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am only smiling at my own
thoughts."</p>
<p id="id00479">"What are they?" (Without waiting for an
answer)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Now, <i>do</i> tell me where you are
going."</p>
<p id="id00480">"Where Fate may lead me. My business is to earn a
living where I can find it."</p>
<p id="id00481">"To earn!" (in consternation) "are you poor,
then?"</p>
<p id="id00482">"As poor as Job."</p>
<p id="id00483">(After a pause)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Bah! how
unpleasant! But <i>I</i> know what it is to be poor: they are poor
enough at home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;papa and mamma, and all of them.
Papa is called Captain Fanshawe; he is an officer on half-pay, but
well-descended, and some of our connections are great enough; but
my uncle and godpapa De Bassompierre, who lives in France, is the
only one that helps us: he educates us girls. I have five sisters
and three brothers. By-and-by we are to
marry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rather elderly gentlemen, I suppose, with
cash: papa and mamma manage that. My sister Augusta is married now
to a man much older-looking than papa. Augusta is very
beautiful&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not in my style&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but
dark; her husband, Mr. Davies, had the yellow fever in India, and
he is still the colour of a guinea; but then he is rich, and
Augusta has her carriage and establishment, and we all think she
has done perfectly well. Now, this is better than 'earning a
living,' as you say. By the way, are you clever?"</p>
<p id="id00484">"No&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not at all."</p>
<p id="id00485">"You can play, sing, speak three or four
languages?"</p>
<p id="id00486">"By no means."</p>
<p id="id00487">"Still I think you are clever" (a pause and a
yawn).</p>
<p id="id00488">"Shall you be sea-sick?"</p>
<p id="id00489">"Shall you?"</p>
<p id="id00490">"Oh, immensely! as soon as ever we get in sight of
the sea: I begin, indeed, to feel it already. I shall go below; and
won't I order about that fat odious stewardess! Heureusement je
sais faire aller mon monde."</p>
<p id="id00491">Down she went.</p>
<p id="id00492">It was not long before the other passengers
followed her: throughout the afternoon I remained on deck alone.
When I recall the tranquil, and even happy mood in which I passed
those hours, and remember, at the same time, the position in which
I was placed; its hazardous&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some would have said
its hopeless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;character; I feel that,
as&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id00493">&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Stone walls do not a
prison make,<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Nor iron bars&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
cage,<br /></p>
<p id="id00494">so peril, loneliness, an uncertain future, are not
oppressive evils, so long as the frame is healthy and the faculties
are employed; so long, especially, as Liberty lends us her wings,
and Hope guides us by her star.</p>
<p id="id00495">I was not sick till long after we passed Margate,
and deep was the pleasure I drank in with the sea-breeze; divine
the delight I drew from the heaving Channel waves, from the
sea-birds on their ridges, from the white sails on their dark
distance, from the quiet yet beclouded sky, overhanging all. In my
reverie, methought I saw the continent of Europe, like a wide
dream-land, far away. Sunshine lay on it, making the long coast one
line of gold; tiniest tracery of clustered town and snow-gleaming
tower, of woods deep massed, of heights serrated, of smooth
pasturage and veiny stream, embossed the metal-bright prospect. For
background, spread a sky, solemn and dark blue,
and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;grand with imperial promise, soft with tints
of enchantment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strode from north to south a
God-bent bow, an arch of hope.</p>
<p id="id00496">Cancel the whole of that, if you please,
reader&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or rather let it stand, and draw thence a
moral&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an alliterative, text-hand
copy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id00497">Day-dreams are delusions of the demon.</p>
<p id="id00498">Becoming excessively sick, I faltered down into the
cabin.</p>
<p id="id00499">Miss Fanshawe's berth chanced to be next mine; and,
I am sorry to say, she tormented me with an unsparing selfishness
during the whole time of our mutual distress. Nothing could exceed
her impatience and fretfulness. The Watsons, who were very sick
too, and on whom the stewardess attended with shameless partiality,
were stoics compared with her. Many a time since have I noticed, in
persons of Ginevra Fanshawe's light, careless temperament, and
fair, fragile style of beauty, an entire incapacity to endure: they
seem to sour in adversity, like small beer in thunder. The man who
takes such a woman for his wife, ought to be prepared to guarantee
her an existence all sunshine. Indignant at last with her teasing
peevishness, I curtly requested her "to hold her tongue." The
rebuff did her good, and it was observable that she liked me no
worse for it.</p>
<p id="id00500">As dark night drew on, the sea roughened: larger
waves swayed strong against the vessel's side. It was strange to
reflect that blackness and water were round us, and to feel the
ship ploughing straight on her pathless way, despite noise, billow,
and rising gale. Articles of furniture began to fall about, and it
became needful to lash them to their places; the passengers grew
sicker than ever; Miss Fanshawe declared, with groans, that she
must die.</p>
<p id="id00501">"Not just yet, honey," said the stewardess. "We're
just in port." Accordingly, in another quarter of an hour, a calm
fell upon us all; and about midnight the voyage ended.</p>
<p id="id00502">I was sorry: yes, I was sorry. My resting-time was
past; my difficulties&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my stringent
difficulties&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;recommenced. When I went on deck,
the cold air and black scowl of the night seemed to rebuke me for
my presumption in being where I was: the lights of the foreign
sea-port town, glimmering round the foreign harbour, met me like
unnumbered threatening eyes. Friends came on board to welcome the
Watsons; a whole family of friends surrounded and bore away Miss
Fanshawe; I&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but I dared not for one moment dwell
on a comparison of positions.</p>
<p id="id00503">Yet where should I go? I must go somewhere.
Necessity dare not be nice. As I gave the stewardess her
fee&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and she seemed surprised at receiving a coin
of more value than, from such a quarter, her coarse calculations
had probably reckoned on&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I said, "Be kind enough
to direct me to some quiet, respectable inn, where I can go for the
night."</p>
<p id="id00504">She not only gave me the required direction, but
called a commissionaire, and bid him take charge of me,
and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>not</i> my trunk, for that was gone to
the custom-house.</p>
<p id="id00505">I followed this man along a rudely-paved street,
lit now by a fitful gleam of moonlight; he brought me to the inn. I
offered him sixpence, which he refused to take; supposing it not
enough, I changed it for a shilling; but this also he declined,
speaking rather sharply, in a language to me unknown. A waiter,
coming forward into the lamp-lit inn-passage, reminded me, in
broken English, that my money was foreign money, not current here.
I gave him a sovereign to change. This little matter settled, I
asked for a bedroom; supper I could not take: I was still sea-sick
and unnerved, and trembling all over. How deeply glad I was when
the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my
exhaustion. Again I might rest: though the cloud of doubt would be
as thick to-morrow as ever; the necessity for exertion more urgent,
the peril (of destitution) nearer, the conflict (for existence)
more severe.</p>
<h2 id="id00506" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h5 id="id00507">VILLETTE.</h5>
<p id="id00508" style="margin-top: 2em">I awoke next morning with
courage revived and spirits refreshed: physical debility no longer
enervated my judgment; my mind felt prompt and clear.</p>
<p id="id00509">Just as I finished dressing, a tap came to the
door: I said, "Come in," expecting the chambermaid, whereas a rough
man walked in and said,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id00510">"Gif me your keys, Meess."</p>
<p id="id00511">"Why?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id00512">"Gif!" said he impatiently; and as he half-snatched
them from my hand, he added, "All right! haf your tronc soon."</p>
<p id="id00513">Fortunately it did turn out all right: he was from
the custom-house. Where to go to get some breakfast I could not
tell; but I proceeded, not without hesitation, to descend.</p>
<p id="id00514">I now observed, what I had not noticed in my
extreme weariness last night, viz. that this inn was, in fact, a
large hotel; and as I slowly descended the broad staircase, halting
on each step (for I was in wonderfully little haste to get down), I
gazed at the high ceiling above me, at the painted walls around, at
the wide windows which filled the house with light, at the veined
marble I trod (for the steps were all of marble, though uncarpeted
and not very clean), and contrasting all this with the dimensions
of the closet assigned to me as a chamber, with the extreme modesty
of its appointments, I fell into a philosophizing mood.</p>
<p id="id00515">Much I marvelled at the sagacity evinced by waiters
and chamber-maids in proportioning the accommodation to the guest.
How could inn-servants and ship-stewardesses everywhere tell at a
glance that I, for instance, was an individual of no social
significance, and little burdened by cash? They <i>did</i> know it
evidently: I saw quite well that they all, in a moment's
calculation, estimated me at about the same fractional value. The
fact seemed to me curious and pregnant: I would not disguise from
myself what it indicated, yet managed to keep up my spirits pretty
well under its pressure.</p>
<p id="id00516">Having at last landed in a great hall, full of
skylight glare, I made my way somehow to what proved to be the
coffee-room. It cannot be denied that on entering this room I
trembled somewhat; felt uncertain, solitary, wretched; wished to
Heaven I knew whether I was doing right or wrong; felt convinced
that it was the last, but could not help myself. Acting in the
spirit and with the calm of a fatalist, I sat down at a small
table, to which a waiter presently brought me some breakfast; and I
partook of that meal in a frame of mind not greatly calculated to
favour digestion. There were many other people breakfasting at
other tables in the room; I should have felt rather more happy if
amongst them all I could have seen any women; however, there was
not one&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all present were men. But nobody seemed
to think I was doing anything strange; one or two gentlemen glanced
at me occasionally, but none stared obtrusively: I suppose if there
was anything eccentric in the business, they accounted for it by
this word "Anglaise!"</p>
<p id="id00517">Breakfast over, I must again
move&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in what direction? "Go to Villette," said
an inward voice; prompted doubtless by the recollection of this
slight sentence uttered carelessly and at random by Miss Fanshawe,
as she bid me good-by: "I wish you would come to Madame Beck's; she
has some marmots whom you might look after; she wants an English
gouvernante, or was wanting one two months ago."</p>
<p id="id00518">Who Madame Beck was, where she lived, I knew not; I
had asked, but the question passed unheard: Miss Fanshawe, hurried
away by her friends, left it unanswered. I presumed Villette to be
her residence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to Villette I would go. The
distance was forty miles. I knew I was catching at straws; but in
the wide and weltering deep where I found myself, I would have
caught at cobwebs. Having inquired about the means of travelling to
Villette, and secured a seat in the diligence, I departed on the
strength of this outline&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this shadow of a
project. Before you pronounce on the rashness of the proceeding,
reader, look back to the point whence I started; consider the
desert I had left, note how little I perilled: mine was the game
where the player cannot lose and may win.</p>
<p id="id00519">Of an artistic temperament, I deny that I am; yet I
must possess something of the artist's faculty of making the most
of present pleasure: that is to say, when it is of the kind to my
taste. I enjoyed that day, though we travelled slowly, though it
was cold, though it rained. Somewhat bare, flat, and treeless was
the route along which our journey lay; and slimy canals crept, like
half-torpid green snakes, beside the road; and formal pollard
willows edged level fields, tilled like kitchen-garden beds. The
sky, too, was monotonously gray; the atmosphere was stagnant and
humid; yet amidst all these deadening influences, my fancy budded
fresh and my heart basked in sunshine. These feelings, however,
were well kept in check by the secret but ceaseless consciousness
of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment, like a tiger crouched in a
jungle. The breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear always;
his fierce heart panted close against mine; he never stirred in his
lair but I felt him: I knew he waited only for sun-down to bound
ravenous from his ambush.</p>
<p id="id00520">I had hoped we might reach Villette ere night set
in, and that thus I might escape the deeper embarrassment which
obscurity seems to throw round a first arrival at an unknown
bourne; but, what with our slow progress and long
stoppages&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what with a thick fog and small, dense
rain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;darkness, that might almost be felt, had
settled on the city by the time we gained its suburbs.</p>
<p id="id00521">I know we passed through a gate where soldiers were
stationed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so much I could see by lamplight;
then, having left behind us the miry Chauss&Atilde;&copy;e, we
rattled over a pavement of strangely rough and flinty surface. At a
bureau, the diligence stopped, and the passengers alighted. My
first business was to get my trunk; a small matter enough, but
important to me. Understanding that it was best not to be
importunate or over-eager about luggage, but to wait and watch
quietly the delivery of other boxes till I saw my own, and then
promptly claim and secure it, I stood apart; my eye fixed on that
part of the vehicle in which I had seen my little portmanteau
safely stowed, and upon which piles of additional bags and boxes
were now heaped. One by one, I saw these removed, lowered, and
seized on.</p>
<p id="id00522">I was sure mine ought to be by this time visible:
it was not. I had tied on the direction-card with a piece of green
ribbon, that I might know it at a glance: not a fringe or fragment
of green was perceptible. Every package was removed; every tin-case
and brown-paper parcel; the oilcloth cover was lifted; I saw with
distinct vision that not an umbrella, cloak, cane, hat-box or
band-box remained.</p>
<p id="id00523">And my portmanteau, with my few clothes and little
pocket-book enclasping the remnant of my fifteen pounds, where were
they?</p>
<p id="id00524">I ask this question now, but I could not ask it
then. I could say nothing whatever; not possessing a phrase of
<i>speaking</i> French: and it was French, and French only, the
whole world seemed now gabbling around me. <i>What</i> should I do?
Approaching the conductor, I just laid my hand on his arm, pointed
to a trunk, thence to the diligence-roof, and tried to express a
question with my eyes. He misunderstood me, seized the trunk
indicated, and was about to hoist it on the vehicle.</p>
<p id="id00525">"Let that alone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will you?" said
a voice in good English; then, in correction, "Qu'est-ce que vous
fa&Atilde;&reg;tes donc? Cette malle est &Atilde;&nbsp; moi."</p>
<p id="id00526">But I had heard the Fatherland accents; they
rejoiced my heart; I turned: "Sir," said I, appealing to the
stranger, without, in my distress, noticing what he was like, "I
cannot speak French. May I entreat you to ask this man what he has
done with my trunk?"</p>
<p id="id00527">Without discriminating, for the moment, what sort
of face it was to which my eyes were raised and on which they were
fixed, I felt in its expression half-surprise at my appeal and
half-doubt of the wisdom of interference.</p>
<p id="id00528">"<i>Do</i> ask him; I would do as much for you,"
said I.</p>
<p id="id00529">I don't know whether he smiled, but he said in a
gentlemanly tone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is to say, a tone not hard
nor terrifying,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"What sort of trunk was
yours?"</p>
<p id="id00530">I described it, including in my description the
green ribbon. And forthwith he took the conductor under hand, and I
felt, through all the storm of French which followed, that he raked
him fore and aft. Presently he returned to me.</p>
<p id="id00531">"The fellow avers he was overloaded, and confesses
that he removed your trunk after you saw it put on, and has left it
behind at Boue-Marine with other parcels; he has promised, however,
to forward it to-morrow; the day after, therefore, you will find it
safe at this bureau."</p>
<p id="id00532">"Thank you," said I: but my heart sank.</p>
<p id="id00533">Meantime what should I do? Perhaps this English
gentleman saw the failure of courage in my face; he inquired
kindly, "Have you any friends in this city?"</p>
<p id="id00534">"No, and I don't know where to go."</p>
<p id="id00535">There was a little pause, in the course of which,
as he turned more fully to the light of a lamp above him, I saw
that he was a young, distinguished, and handsome man; he might be a
lord, for anything I knew: nature had made him good enough for a
prince, I thought. His face was very pleasant; he looked high but
not arrogant, manly but not overbearing. I was turning away, in the
deep consciousness of all absence of claim to look for further help
from such a one as he.</p>
<p id="id00536">"Was all your money in your trunk?" he asked,
stopping me.</p>
<p id="id00537">How thankful was I to be able to answer with
truth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"No. I have enough in my purse" (for I had
near twenty francs) "to keep me at a quiet inn till the day after
to-morrow; but I am quite a stranger in Villette, and don't know
the streets and the inns."</p>
<p id="id00538">"I can give you the address of such an inn as you
want," said he; "and it is not far off: with my direction you will
easily find it."</p>
<p id="id00539">He tore a leaf from his pocket-book, wrote a few
words and gave it to me. I <i>did</i> think him kind; and as to
distrusting him, or his advice, or his address, I should almost as
soon have thought of distrusting the Bible. There was goodness in
his countenance, and honour in his bright eyes.</p>
<p id="id00540">"Your shortest way will be to follow the Boulevard
and cross the park," he continued; "but it is too late and too dark
for a woman to go through the park alone; I will step with you thus
far."</p>
<p id="id00541">He moved on, and I followed him, through the
darkness and the small soaking rain. The Boulevard was all
deserted, its path miry, the water dripping from its trees; the
park was black as midnight. In the double gloom of trees and fog, I
could not see my guide; I could only follow his tread. Not the
least fear had I: I believe I would have followed that frank tread,
through continual night, to the world's end.</p>
<p id="id00542">"Now," said he, when the park was traversed, "you
will go along this broad street till you come to steps; two lamps
will show you where they are: these steps you will descend: a
narrower street lies below; following that, at the bottom you will
find your inn. They speak English there, so your difficulties are
now pretty well over. Good-night."</p>
<p id="id00543">"Good-night, sir," said I: "accept my sincerest
thanks." And we parted.</p>
<p id="id00544">The remembrance of his countenance, which I am sure
wore a light not unbenignant to the
friendless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the sound in my ear of his voice,
which spoke a nature chivalric to the needy and feeble, as well as
the youthful and fair&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were a sort of cordial to
me long after. He was a true young English gentleman.</p>
<p id="id00545">On I went, hurrying fast through a magnificent
street and square, with the grandest houses round, and amidst them
the huge outline of more than one overbearing pile; which might be
palace or church&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I could not tell. Just as I
passed a portico, two mustachioed men came suddenly from behind the
pillars; they were smoking cigars: their dress implied pretensions
to the rank of gentlemen, but, poor things! they were very plebeian
in soul. They spoke with insolence, and, fast as I walked, they
kept pace with me a long way. At last I met a sort of patrol, and
my dreaded hunters were turned from the pursuit; but they had
driven me beyond my reckoning: when I could collect my faculties, I
no longer knew where I was; the staircase I must long since have
passed. Puzzled, out of breath, all my pulses throbbing in
inevitable agitation, I knew not where to turn. It was terrible to
think of again encountering those bearded, sneering simpletons; yet
the ground must be retraced, and the steps sought out.</p>
<p id="id00546">I came at last to an old and worn flight, and,
taking it for granted that this must be the one indicated, I
descended them. The street into which they led was indeed narrow,
but it contained no inn. On I wandered. In a very quiet and
comparatively clean and well-paved street, I saw a light burning
over the door of a rather large house, loftier by a story than
those round it. <i>This</i> might be the inn at last. I hastened
on: my knees now trembled under me: I was getting quite
exhausted.</p>
<p id="id00547">No inn was this. A brass-plate embellished the
great porte-coch&Atilde;&uml;re:<br />
"Pensionnat de Demoiselles" was the inscription; and beneath, a
name,<br />
"Madame Beck."<br /></p>
<p id="id00548">I started. About a hundred thoughts volleyed
through my mind in a moment. Yet I planned nothing, and considered
nothing: I had not time. Providence said, "Stop here; this is
<i>your</i> inn." Fate took me in her strong hand; mastered my
will; directed my actions: I rang the door-bell.</p>
<p id="id00549">While I waited, I would not reflect. I fixedly
looked at the street-stones, where the door-lamp shone, and counted
them and noted their shapes, and the glitter of wet on their
angles. I rang again. They opened at last. A bonne in a smart cap
stood before me.</p>
<p id="id00550">"May I see Madame Beck?" I inquired.</p>
<p id="id00551">I believe if I had spoken French she would not have
admitted me; but, as I spoke English, she concluded I was a foreign
teacher come on business connected with the pensionnat, and, even
at that late hour, she let me in, without a word of reluctance, or
a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p id="id00552">The next moment I sat in a cold, glittering salon,
with porcelain stove, unlit, and gilded ornaments, and polished
floor. A pendule on the mantel-piece struck nine o'clock.</p>
<p id="id00553">A quarter of an hour passed. How fast beat every
pulse in my frame! How I turned cold and hot by turns! I sat with
my eyes fixed on the door&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a great white
folding-door, with gilt mouldings: I watched to see a leaf move and
open. All had been quiet: not a mouse had stirred; the white doors
were closed and motionless.</p>
<p id="id00554">"You ayre Engliss?" said a voice at my elbow. I
almost bounded, so unexpected was the sound; so certain had I been
of solitude.</p>
<p id="id00555">No ghost stood beside me, nor anything of spectral
aspect; merely a motherly, dumpy little woman, in a large shawl, a
wrapping-gown, and a clean, trim nightcap.</p>
<p id="id00556">I said I was English, and immediately, without
further prelude, we fell to a most remarkable conversation. Madame
Beck (for Madame Beck it was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she had entered by
a little door behind me, and, being shod with the shoes of silence,
I had heard neither her entrance nor
approach)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Madame Beck had exhausted her command
of insular speech when she said, "You ayre Engliss," and she now
proceeded to work away volubly in her own tongue. I answered in
mine. She partly understood me, but as I did not at all understand
her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though we made together an awful clamour
(anything like Madame's gift of utterance I had not hitherto heard
or imagined)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;we achieved little progress. She
rang, ere long, for aid; which arrived in the shape of a
"ma&Atilde;&reg;tresse," who had been partly educated in an Irish
convent, and was esteemed a perfect adept in the English language.
A bluff little personage this ma&Atilde;&reg;tresse
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Labassecourienne from top to toe: and how
she did slaughter the speech of Albion! However, I told her a plain
tale, which she translated. I told her how I had left my own
country, intent on extending my knowledge, and gaining my bread;
how I was ready to turn my hand to any useful thing, provided it
was not wrong or degrading; how I would be a child's-nurse, or a
lady's-maid, and would not refuse even housework adapted to my
strength. Madame heard this; and, questioning her countenance, I
almost thought the tale won her ear:</p>
<p id="id00557">"Il n'y a que les Anglaises pour ces sortes
d'entreprises," said she: "sont-elles donc intr&Atilde;&copy;pides
ces femmes l&Atilde;&nbsp;!"</p>
<p id="id00558">She asked my name, my age; she sat and looked at
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not pityingly, not with interest: never a
gleam of sympathy, or a shade of compassion, crossed her
countenance during the interview. I felt she was not one to be led
an inch by her feelings: grave and considerate, she gazed,
consulting her judgment and studying my narrative. A bell rang.</p>
<p id="id00559">"Voil&Atilde;&nbsp; pour la pri&Atilde;&uml;re du
soir!" said she, and rose. Through her interpreter, she desired me
to depart now, and come back on the morrow; but this did not suit
me: I could not bear to return to the perils of darkness and the
street. With energy, yet with a collected and controlled manner, I
said, addressing herself personally, and not the
ma&Atilde;&reg;tresse: "Be assured, madame, that by instantly
securing my services, your interests will be served and not
injured: you will find me one who will wish to give, in her labour,
a full equivalent for her wages; and if you hire me, it will be
better that I should stay here this night: having no acquaintance
in Villette, and not possessing the language of the country, how
can I secure a lodging?"</p>
<p id="id00560">"It is true," said she; "but at least you can give
a reference?"</p>
<p id="id00561">"None."</p>
<p id="id00562">She inquired after my luggage: I told her when it
would arrive. She mused. At that moment a man's step was heard in
the vestibule, hastily proceeding to the outer door. (I shall go on
with this part of my tale as if I had understood all that passed;
for though it was then scarce intelligible to me, I heard it
translated afterwards).</p>
<p id="id00563">"Who goes out now?" demanded Madame Beck, listening
to the tread.</p>
<p id="id00564">"M. Paul," replied the teacher. "He came this
evening to give a reading to the first class."</p>
<p id="id00565">"The very man I should at this moment most wish to
see. Call him."</p>
<p id="id00566">The teacher ran to the salon door. M. Paul was
summoned. He entered: a small, dark and spare man, in
spectacles.</p>
<p id="id00567">"Mon cousin," began Madame, "I want your opinion.
We know your skill in physiognomy; use it now. Read that
countenance."</p>
<p id="id00568">The little man fixed on me his spectacles: A
resolute compression of the lips, and gathering of the brow, seemed
to say that he meant to see through me, and that a veil would be no
veil for him.</p>
<p id="id00569">"I read it," he pronounced.</p>
<p id="id00570">"Et qu'en dites vous?"</p>
<p id="id00571">"Mais&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bien des choses," was the
oracular answer.</p>
<p id="id00572">"Bad or good?"</p>
<p id="id00573">"Of each kind, without doubt," pursued the
diviner.</p>
<p id="id00574">"May one trust her word?"</p>
<p id="id00575">"Are you negotiating a matter of importance?"</p>
<p id="id00576">"She wishes me to engage her as bonne or
gouvernante; tells a tale full of integrity, but gives no
reference."</p>
<p id="id00577">"She is a stranger?"</p>
<p id="id00578">"An Englishwoman, as one may see."</p>
<p id="id00579">"She speaks French?"</p>
<p id="id00580">"Not a word."</p>
<p id="id00581">"She understands it?"</p>
<p id="id00582">"No."</p>
<p id="id00583">"One may then speak plainly in her presence?"</p>
<p id="id00584">"Doubtless."</p>
<p id="id00585">He gazed steadily. "Do you need her services?"</p>
<p id="id00586">"I could do with them. You know I am disgusted with
Madame Svini."</p>
<p id="id00587">Still he scrutinized. The judgment, when it at last
came, was as indefinite as what had gone before it.</p>
<p id="id00588">"Engage her. If good predominates in that nature,
the action will bring its own reward; if evil&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;eh
bien! ma cousine, ce sera toujours une bonne oeuvre." And with a
bow and a "bon soir," this vague arbiter of my destiny
vanished.</p>
<p id="id00589">And Madame did engage me that very
night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;by God's blessing I was spared the
necessity of passing forth again into the lonesome, dreary, hostile
street.</p>
<h2 id="id00590" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h5 id="id00591">MADAME BECK.</h5>
<p id="id00592" style="margin-top: 2em">Being delivered into the
charge of the ma&Atilde;&reg;tresse, I was led through a long
narrow passage into a foreign kitchen, very clean but very strange.
It seemed to contain no means of cooking&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;neither
fireplace nor oven; I did not understand that the great black
furnace which filled one corner, was an efficient substitute for
these. Surely pride was not already beginning its whispers in my
heart; yet I felt a sense of relief when, instead of being left in
the kitchen, as I half anticipated, I was led forward to a small
inner room termed a "cabinet." A cook in a jacket, a short
petticoat and sabots, brought my supper: to
wit&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some meat, nature unknown, served in an odd
and acid, but pleasant sauce; some chopped potatoes, made savoury
with, I know not what: vinegar and sugar, I think: a tartine, or
slice of bread and butter, and a baked pear. Being hungry, I ate
and was grateful.</p>
<p id="id00593">After the "pri&Atilde;&uml;re du soir," Madame
herself came to have another look at me. She desired me to follow
her up-stairs. Through a series of the queerest little
dormitories&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which, I heard afterwards, had once
been nuns' cells: for the premises were in part of ancient
date&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and through the
oratory&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a long, low, gloomy room, where a
crucifix hung, pale, against the wall, and two tapers kept dim
vigils&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she conducted me to an apartment where
three children were asleep in three tiny beds. A heated stove made
the air of this room oppressive; and, to mend matters, it was
scented with an odour rather strong than delicate: a perfume,
indeed, altogether surprising and unexpected under the
circumstances, being like the combination of smoke with some
spirituous essence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a smell, in short, of
whisky.</p>
<p id="id00594">Beside a table, on which flared the remnant of a
candle guttering to waste in the socket, a coarse woman,
heterogeneously clad in a broad striped showy silk dress, and a
stuff apron, sat in a chair fast asleep. To complete the picture,
and leave no doubt as to the state of matters, a bottle and an
empty glass stood at the sleeping beauty's elbow.</p>
<p id="id00595">Madame contemplated this remarkable tableau with
great calm; she neither smiled nor scowled; no impress of anger,
disgust, or surprise, ruffled the equality of her grave aspect; she
did not even wake the woman! Serenely pointing to a fourth bed, she
intimated that it was to be mine; then, having extinguished the
candle and substituted for it a night-lamp, she glided through an
inner door, which she left ajar&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the entrance to
her own chamber, a large, well-furnished apartment; as was
discernible through the aperture.</p>
<p id="id00596">My devotions that night were all thanksgiving.
Strangely had I been led since
morning&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;unexpectedly had I been provided for.
Scarcely could I believe that not forty-eight hours had elapsed
since I left London, under no other guardianship than that which
protects the passenger-bird&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with no prospect but
the dubious cloud-tracery of hope.</p>
<p id="id00597">I was a light sleeper; in the dead of night I
suddenly awoke. All was hushed, but a white figure stood in the
room&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Madame in her night-dress. Moving without
perceptible sound, she visited the three children in the three
beds; she approached me: I feigned sleep, and she studied me long.
A small pantomime ensued, curious enough. I daresay she sat a
quarter of an hour on the edge of my bed, gazing at my face. She
then drew nearer, bent close over me; slightly raised my cap, and
turned back the border so as to expose my hair; she looked at my
hand lying on the bedclothes. This done, she turned to the chair
where my clothes lay: it was at the foot of the bed. Hearing her
touch and lift them, I opened my eyes with precaution, for I own I
felt curious to see how far her taste for research would lead her.
It led her a good way: every article did she inspect. I divined her
motive for this proceeding, viz. the wish to form from the garments
a judgment respecting the wearer, her station, means, neatness,
&amp;c. The end was not bad, but the means were hardly fair or
justifiable. In my dress was a pocket; she fairly turned it inside
out: she counted the money in my purse; she opened a little
memorandum-book, coolly perused its contents, and took from between
the leaves a small plaited lock of Miss Marchmont's grey hair. To a
bunch of three keys, being those of my trunk, desk, and work-box,
she accorded special attention: with these, indeed, she withdrew a
moment to her own room. I softly rose in my bed and followed her
with my eye: these keys, reader, were not brought back till they
had left on the toilet of the adjoining room the impress of their
wards in wax. All being thus done decently and in order, my
property was returned to its place, my clothes were carefully
refolded. Of what nature were the conclusions deduced from this
scrutiny? Were they favourable or otherwise? Vain question.
Madame's face of stone (for of stone in its present night aspect it
looked: it had been human, and, as I said before, motherly, in the
salon) betrayed no response.</p>
<p id="id00598">Her duty done&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I felt that in her
eyes this business was a duty&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she rose,
noiseless as a shadow: she moved towards her own chamber; at the
door, she turned, fixing her eye on the heroine of the bottle, who
still slept and loudly snored. Mrs. Svini (I presume this was Mrs.
Svini, Anglic&Atilde;&copy; or Hibernic&Atilde;&copy;,
Sweeny)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Mrs. Sweeny's doom was in Madame Beck's
eye&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an immutable purpose that eye spoke:
Madame's visitations for shortcomings might be slow, but they were
sure. All this was very un-English: truly I was in a foreign
land.</p>
<p id="id00599">The morrow made me further acquainted with Mrs.
Sweeny. It seems she had introduced herself to her present employer
as an English lady in reduced circumstances: a native, indeed, of
Middlesex, professing to speak the English tongue with the purest
metropolitan accent. Madame&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;reliant on her own
infallible expedients for finding out the truth in
time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had a singular intrepidity in hiring
service off-hand (as indeed seemed abundantly proved in my own
case). She received Mrs. Sweeny as nursery-governess to her three
children. I need hardly explain to the reader that this lady was in
effect a native of Ireland; her station I do not pretend to fix:
she boldly declared that she had "had the bringing-up of the son
and daughter of a marquis." I think myself, she might possibly have
been a hanger-on, nurse, fosterer, or washerwoman, in some Irish
family: she spoke a smothered tongue, curiously overlaid with
mincing cockney inflections. By some means or other she had
acquired, and now held in possession, a wardrobe of rather
suspicious splendour&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gowns of stiff and costly
silk, fitting her indifferently, and apparently made for other
proportions than those they now adorned; caps with real lace
borders, and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the chief item in the inventory,
the spell by which she struck a certain awe through the household,
quelling the otherwise scornfully disposed teachers and servants,
and, so long as her broad shoulders <i>wore</i> the folds of that
majestic drapery, even influencing Madame
herself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>a real Indian
shawl</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"un v&Atilde;&copy;ritable cachemire,"
as Madame Beck said, with unmixed reverence and amaze. I feel quite
sure that without this "cachemire" she would not have kept her
footing in the pensionnat for two days: by virtue of it, and it
only, she maintained the same a month.</p>
<p id="id00600">But when Mrs. Sweeny knew that I was come to fill
her shoes, then it was that she declared
herself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;then did she rise on Madame Beck in her
full power&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;then come down on me with her
concentrated weight. Madame bore this revelation and visitation so
well, so stoically, that I for very shame could not support it
otherwise than with composure. For one little moment Madame Beck
absented herself from the room; ten minutes after, an agent of the
police stood in the midst of us. Mrs. Sweeny and her effects were
removed. Madame's brow had not been ruffled during the
scene&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her lips had not dropped one
sharply-accented word.</p>
<p id="id00601">This brisk little affair of the dismissal was all
settled before breakfast: order to march given, policeman called,
mutineer expelled; "chambre d'enfans" fumigated and cleansed,
windows thrown open, and every trace of the accomplished Mrs.
Sweeny&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even to the fine essence and spiritual
fragrance which gave token so subtle and so fatal of the head and
front of her offending&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was annihilated from the
Rue Fossette: all this, I say, was done between the moment of
Madame Beck's issuing like Aurora from her chamber, and that in
which she coolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee.</p>
<p id="id00602">About noon, I was summoned to dress Madame. (It
appeared my place was to be a hybrid between gouvernante and
lady's-maid.) Till noon, she haunted the house in her
wrapping-gown, shawl, and soundless slippers. How would the
lady-chief of an English school approve this custom?</p>
<p id="id00603">The dressing of her hair puzzled me; she had plenty
of it: auburn, unmixed with grey: though she was forty years old.
Seeing my embarrassment, she said, "You have not been a
femme-de-chambre in your own country?" And taking the brush from my
hand, and setting me aside, not ungently or disrespectfully, she
arranged it herself. In performing other offices of the toilet, she
half-directed, half-aided me, without the least display of temper
or impatience. N.B.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;That was the first and last
time I was required to dress her. Henceforth, on Rosine, the
portress, devolved that duty.</p>
<p id="id00604">When attired, Madame Beck appeared a personage of a
figure rather short and stout, yet still graceful in its own
peculiar way; that is, with the grace resulting from proportion of
parts. Her complexion was fresh and sanguine, not too rubicund; her
eye, blue and serene; her dark silk dress fitted her as a French
sempstress alone can make a dress fit; she looked well, though a
little bourgeoise; as bourgeoise, indeed, she was. I know not what
of harmony pervaded her whole person; and yet her face offered
contrast, too: its features were by no means such as are usually
seen in conjunction with a complexion of such blended freshness and
repose: their outline was stern: her forehead was high but narrow;
it expressed capacity and some benevolence, but no expanse; nor did
her peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled
in the heart or the softness which flows thence. Her mouth was
hard: it could be a little grim; her lips were thin. For
sensibility and genius, with all their tenderness and temerity, I
felt somehow that Madame would be the right sort of Minos in
petticoats.</p>
<p id="id00605">In the long run, I found she was something else in
petticoats too. Her name was Modeste Maria Beck, n&Atilde;&copy;e
Kint: it ought to have been Ignacia. She was a charitable woman,
and did a great deal of good. There never was a mistress whose rule
was milder. I was told that she never once remonstrated with the
intolerable Mrs. Sweeny, despite her tipsiness, disorder, and
general neglect; yet Mrs. Sweeny had to go the moment her departure
became convenient. I was told, too, that neither masters nor
teachers were found fault with in that establishment; yet both
masters and teachers were often changed: they vanished and others
filled their places, none could well explain how.</p>
<p id="id00606">The establishment was both a pensionnat and an
externat: the externes or day-pupils exceeded one hundred in
number; the boarders were about a score. Madame must have possessed
high administrative powers: she ruled all these, together with four
teachers, eight masters, six servants, and three children, managing
at the same time to perfection the pupils' parents and friends; and
that without apparent effort; without bustle, fatigue, fever, or
any symptom of undue, excitement: occupied she always
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;busy, rarely. It is true that Madame had her
own system for managing and regulating this mass of machinery; and
a very pretty system it was: the reader has seen a specimen of it,
in that small affair of turning my pocket inside out, and reading
my private memoranda. "Surveillance,"
"espionage,"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these were her watchwords.</p>
<p id="id00607">Still, Madame knew what honesty was, and liked
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is, when it did not obtrude its clumsy
scruples in the way of her will and interest. She had a respect for
"Angleterre;" and as to "les Anglaises," she would have the women
of no other country about her own children, if she could help
it.</p>
<p id="id00608">Often in the evening, after she had been plotting
and counter-plotting, spying and receiving the reports of spies all
day, she would come up to my room&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a trace of
real weariness on her brow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and she would sit
down and listen while the children said their little prayers to me
in English: the Lord's Prayer, and the hymn beginning "Gentle
Jesus," these little Catholics were permitted to repeat at my knee;
and, when I had put them to bed, she would talk to me (I soon
gained enough French to be able to understand, and even answer her)
about England and Englishwomen, and the reasons for what she was
pleased to term their superior intelligence, and more real and
reliable probity. Very good sense she often showed; very sound
opinions she often broached: she seemed to know that keeping girls
in distrustful restraint, in blind ignorance, and under a
surveillance that left them no moment and no corner for retirement,
was not the best way to make them grow up honest and modest women;
but she averred that ruinous consequences would ensue if any other
method were tried with continental children: they were so
accustomed to restraint, that relaxation, however guarded, would be
misunderstood and fatally presumed on. She was sick, she would
declare, of the means she had to use, but use them she must; and
after discoursing, often with dignity and delicacy, to me, she
would move away on her "souliers de silence," and glide ghost-like
through the house, watching and spying everywhere, peering through
every keyhole, listening behind every door.</p>
<p id="id00609">After all, Madame's system was not
bad&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;let me do her justice. Nothing could be
better than all her arrangements for the physical well-being of her
scholars. No minds were overtasked: the lessons were well
distributed and made incomparably easy to the learner; there was a
liberty of amusement, and a provision for exercise which kept the
girls healthy; the food was abundant and good: neither pale nor
puny faces were anywhere to be seen in the Rue Fossette. She never
grudged a holiday; she allowed plenty of time for sleeping,
dressing, washing, eating; her method in all these matters was
easy, liberal, salutary, and rational: many an austere English
school-mistress would do vastly well to imitate
her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I believe many would be glad to do so,
if exacting English parents would let them.</p>
<p id="id00610">As Madame Beck ruled by espionage, she of course
had her staff of spies: she perfectly knew the quality of the tools
she used, and while she would not scruple to handle the dirtiest
for a dirty occasion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;flinging this sort from her
like refuse rind, after the orange has been duly
squeezed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I have known her fastidious in seeking
pure metal for clean uses; and when once a bloodless and rustless
instrument was found, she was careful of the prize, keeping it in
silk and cotton-wool. Yet, woe be to that man or woman who relied
on her one inch beyond the point where it was her interest to be
trustworthy: interest was the master-key of Madame's
nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the mainspring of her
motives&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the alpha and omega of her life. I have
seen her <i>feelings</i> appealed to, and I have smiled in
half-pity, half-scorn at the appellants. None ever gained her ear
through that channel, or swayed her purpose by that means. On the
contrary, to attempt to touch her heart was the surest way to rouse
her antipathy, and to make of her a secret foe. It proved to her
that she had no heart to be touched: it reminded her where she was
impotent and dead. Never was the distinction between charity and
mercy better exemplified than in her. While devoid of sympathy, she
had a sufficiency of rational benevolence: she would give in the
readiest manner to people she had never
seen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rather, however, to classes than to
individuals. "Pour les pauvres," she opened her purse
freely&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;against <i>the poor man</i>, as a rule,
she kept it closed. In philanthropic schemes for the benefit of
society at large she took a cheerful part; no private sorrow
touched her: no force or mass of suffering concentrated in one
heart had power to pierce hers. Not the agony in Gethsemane, not
the death on Calvary, could have wrung from her eyes one tear.</p>
<p id="id00611">I say again, Madame was a very great and a very
capable woman. That school offered her for her powers too limited a
sphere; she ought to have swayed a nation: she should have been the
leader of a turbulent legislative assembly. Nobody could have
browbeaten her, none irritated her nerves, exhausted her patience,
or over-reached her astuteness. In her own single person, she could
have comprised the duties of a first minister and a superintendent
of police. Wise, firm, faithless; secret, crafty, passionless;
watchful and inscrutable; acute and
insensate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;withal perfectly
decorous&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what more could be desired?</p>
<p id="id00612">The sensible reader will not suppose that I gained
all the knowledge here condensed for his benefit in one month, or
in one half-year. No! what I saw at first was the thriving outside
of a large and flourishing educational establishment. Here was a
great house, full of healthy, lively girls, all well-dressed and
many of them handsome, gaining knowledge by a marvellously easy
method, without painful exertion or useless waste of spirits; not,
perhaps, making very rapid progress in anything; taking it easy,
but still always employed, and never oppressed. Here was a corps of
teachers and masters, more stringently tasked, as all the real
head-labour was to be done by them, in order to save the pupils,
yet having their duties so arranged that they relieved each other
in quick succession whenever the work was severe: here, in short,
was a foreign school; of which the life, movement, and variety made
it a complete and most charming contrast to many English
institutions of the same kind.</p>
<p id="id00613">Behind the house was a large garden, and, in
summer, the pupils almost lived out of doors amongst the
rose-bushes and the fruit-trees. Under the vast and vine-draped
berceau, Madame would take her seat on summer afternoons, and send
for the classes, in turns, to sit round her and sew and read.
Meantime, masters came and went, delivering short and lively
lectures, rather than lessons, and the pupils made notes of their
instructions, or did <i>not</i> make them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;just
as inclination prompted; secure that, in case of neglect, they
could copy the notes of their companions. Besides the regular
monthly <i>jours de sortie</i>, the Catholic f&Atilde;&ordf;te-days
brought a succession of holidays all the year round; and sometimes
on a bright summer morning, or soft summer evening; the boarders
were taken out for a long walk into the country, regaled with
<i>gaufres</i> and <i>vin blanc</i>, or new milk and <i>pain
bis</i>, or <i>pistolets au beurre</i> (rolls) and coffee. All this
seemed very pleasant, and Madame appeared goodness itself; and the
teachers not so bad but they might be worse; and the pupils,
perhaps, a little noisy and rough, but types of health and
glee.</p>
<p id="id00614">Thus did the view appear, seen through the
enchantment of distance; but there came a time when distance was to
melt for me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when I was to be called down from my
watch-tower of the nursery, whence I had hitherto made my
observations, and was to be compelled into closer intercourse with
this little world of the Rue Fossette.</p>
<p id="id00615">I was one day sitting up-stairs, as usual, hearing
the children their English lessons, and at the same time turning a
silk dress for Madame, when she came sauntering into the room with
that absorbed air and brow of hard thought she sometimes wore, and
which made her look so little genial. Dropping into a seat opposite
mine, she remained some minutes silent.
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e, the eldest girl, was reading to
me some little essay of Mrs. Barbauld's, and I was making her
translate currently from English to French as she proceeded, by way
of ascertaining that she comprehended what she read: Madame
listened.</p>
<p id="id00616">Presently, without preface or prelude, she said,
almost in the tone of one making an accusation, "Meess, in England
you were a governess?"</p>
<p id="id00617">"No, Madame," said I smiling, "you are
mistaken."</p>
<p id="id00618">"Is this your first essay at
teaching&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this attempt with my children?"</p>
<p id="id00619">I assured her it was. Again she became silent; but
looking up, as I took a pin from the cushion, I found myself an
object of study: she held me under her eye; she seemed turning me
round in her thoughts&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;measuring my fitness for a
purpose, weighing my value in a plan. Madame had, ere this,
scrutinized all I had, and I believe she esteemed herself cognizant
of much that I was; but from that day, for the space of about a
fortnight, she tried me by new tests. She listened at the nursery
door when I was shut in with the children; she followed me at a
cautious distance when I walked out with them, stealing within
ear-shot whenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a
sufficient screen: a strict preliminary process having thus been
observed, she made a move forward.</p>
<p id="id00620">One morning, coming on me abruptly, and with the
semblance of hurry, she said she found herself placed in a little
dilemma. Mr. Wilson, the English master, had failed to come at his
hour, she feared he was ill; the pupils were waiting in classe;
there was no one to give a lesson; should I, for once, object to
giving a short dictation exercise, just that the pupils might not
have it to say they had missed their English lesson?</p>
<p id="id00621">"In classe, Madame?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id00622">"Yes, in classe: in the second division."</p>
<p id="id00623">"Where there are sixty pupils," said I; for I knew
the number, and with my usual base habit of cowardice, I shrank
into my sloth like a snail into its shell, and alleged incapacity
and impracticability as a pretext to escape action. If left to
myself, I should infallibly have let this chance slip.
Inadventurous, unstirred by impulses of practical ambition, I was
capable of sitting twenty years teaching infants the hornbook,
turning silk dresses and making children's frocks. Not that true
contentment dignified this infatuated resignation: my work had
neither charm for my taste, nor hold on my interest; but it seemed
to me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety, and relieved from
intimate trial: the negation of severe suffering was the nearest
approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold
two lives&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the life of thought, and that of
reality; and, provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency
of the strange necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the
latter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work, and a roof
of shelter.</p>
<p id="id00624">"Come," said Madame, as I stooped more busily than
ever over the cutting-out of a child's pinafore, "leave that
work."</p>
<p id="id00625">"But Fifine wants it, Madame."</p>
<p id="id00626">"Fifine must want it, then, for I want
<i>you</i>."</p>
<p id="id00627">And as Madame Beck did really want and was resolved
to have me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as she had long been dissatisfied
with the English master, with his shortcomings in punctuality, and
his careless method of tuition&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as, too,
<i>she</i> did not lack resolution and practical activity, whether
<i>I</i> lacked them or not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she, without more
ado, made me relinquish thimble and needle; my hand was taken into
hers, and I was conducted down-stairs. When we reached the
carr&Atilde;&copy;, a large square hall between the dwelling-house
and the pensionnat, she paused, dropped my hand, faced, and
scrutinized me. I was flushed, and tremulous from head to foot:
tell it not in Gath, I believe I was crying. In fact, the
difficulties before me were far from being wholly imaginary; some
of them were real enough; and not the least substantial lay in my
want of mastery over the medium through which I should be obliged
to teach. I had, indeed, studied French closely since my arrival in
Villette; learning its practice by day, and its theory in every
leisure moment at night, to as late an hour as the rule of the
house would allow candle-light; but I was far from yet being able
to trust my powers of correct oral expression.</p>
<p id="id00628">"D&Atilde;&reg;tes donc," said Madame sternly,
"vous sentez vous r&Atilde;&copy;ellement trop faible?"</p>
<p id="id00629">I might have said "Yes," and gone back to nursery
obscurity, and there, perhaps, mouldered for the rest of my life;
but looking up at Madame, I saw in her countenance a something that
made me think twice ere I decided. At that instant she did not wear
a woman's aspect, but rather a man's. Power of a particular kind
strongly limned itself in all her traits, and that power was not my
kind of power: neither sympathy, nor congeniality, nor submission,
were the emotions it awakened. I stood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not
soothed, nor won, nor overwhelmed. It seemed as if a challenge of
strength between opposing gifts was given, and I suddenly felt all
the dishonour of my diffidence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all the
pusillanimity of my slackness to aspire.</p>
<p id="id00630">"Will you," she said, "go backward or forward?"
indicating with her hand, first, the small door of communication
with the dwelling-house, and then the great double portals of the
classes or schoolrooms.</p>
<p id="id00631">"En avant," I said.</p>
<p id="id00632">"But," pursued she, cooling as I warmed, and
continuing the hard look, from very antipathy to which I drew
strength and determination, "can you face the classes, or are you
over-excited?"</p>
<p id="id00633">She sneered slightly in saying this: nervous
excitability was not much to Madame's taste.</p>
<p id="id00634">"I am no more excited than this stone," I said,
tapping the flag with my toe: "or than you," I added, returning her
look.</p>
<p id="id00635">"Bon! But let me tell you these are not quiet,
decorous, English girls you are going to encounter. Ce sont des
Labassecouriennes, rondes, franches, brusques, et tant soit peu
rebelles."</p>
<p id="id00636">I said: "I know; and I know, too, that though I
have studied French hard since I came here, yet I still speak it
with far too much hesitation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too little accuracy
to be able to command their respect I shall make blunders that will
lay me open to the scorn of the most ignorant. Still I mean to give
the lesson."</p>
<p id="id00637">"They always throw over timid teachers," said
she.</p>
<p id="id00638">"I know that too, Madame; I have heard how they
rebelled against and persecuted Miss Turner"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
poor friendless English teacher, whom Madame had employed, and
lightly discarded; and to whose piteous history I was no
stranger.</p>
<p id="id00639">"C'est vrai," said she, coolly. "Miss Turner had no
more command over them than a servant from the kitchen would have
had. She was weak and wavering; she had neither tact nor
intelligence, decision nor dignity. Miss Turner would not do for
these girls at all."</p>
<p id="id00640">I made no reply, but advanced to the closed
schoolroom door.</p>
<p id="id00641">"You will not expect aid from me, or from any one,"
said Madame. "That would at once set you down as incompetent for
your office."</p>
<p id="id00642">I opened the door, let her pass with courtesy, and
followed her. There were three schoolrooms, all large. That
dedicated to the second division, where I was to figure, was
considerably the largest, and accommodated an assemblage more
numerous, more turbulent, and infinitely more unmanageable than the
other two. In after days, when I knew the ground better, I used to
think sometimes (if such a comparison may be permitted), that the
quiet, polished, tame first division was to the robust, riotous,
demonstrative second division, what the English House of Lords is
to the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="id00643">The first glance informed me that many of the
pupils were more than girls&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quite young women; I
knew that some of them were of noble family (as nobility goes in
Labassecour), and I was well convinced that not one amongst them
was ignorant of my position in Madame's household. As I mounted the
estr&Atilde;&nbsp;de (a low platform, raised a step above the
flooring), where stood the teacher's chair and desk, I beheld
opposite to me a row of eyes and brows that threatened stormy
weather&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;eyes full of an insolent light, and
brows hard and unblushing as marble. The continental "female" is
quite a different being to the insular "female" of the same age and
class: I never saw such eyes and brows in England. Madame Beck
introduced me in one cool phrase, sailed from the room, and left me
alone in my glory.</p>
<p id="id00644">I shall never forget that first lesson, nor all the
under-current of life and character it opened up to me. Then first
did I begin rightly to see the wide difference that lies between
the novelist's and poet's ideal "jeune fille" and the said "jeune
fille" as she really is.</p>
<p id="id00645">It seems that three titled belles in the first row
had sat down predetermined that a <i>bonne d'enfants</i> should not
give them lessons in English. They knew they had succeeded in
expelling obnoxious teachers before now; they knew that Madame
would at any time throw overboard a professeur or maitresse who
became unpopular with the school&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that she never
assisted a weak official to retain his
place&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that if he had not strength to fight, or
tact to win his way, down he went: looking at "Miss Snowe," they
promised themselves an easy victory.</p>
<p id="id00646">Mesdemoiselles Blanche, Virginie, and
Ang&Atilde;&copy;lique opened the campaign by a series of
titterings and whisperings; these soon swelled into murmurs and
short laughs, which the remoter benches caught up and echoed more
loudly. This growing revolt of sixty against one, soon became
oppressive enough; my command of French being so limited, and
exercised under such cruel constraint.</p>
<p id="id00647">Could I but have spoken in my own tongue, I felt as
if I might have gained a hearing; for, in the first place, though I
knew I looked a poor creature, and in many respects actually was
so, yet nature had given me a voice that could make itself heard,
if lifted in excitement or deepened by emotion. In the second
place, while I had no flow, only a hesitating trickle of language,
in ordinary circumstances, yet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;under stimulus
such as was now rife through the mutinous mass&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
could, in English, have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing
their proceedings as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized;
and then with some sarcasm, flavoured with contemptuous bitterness
for the ringleaders, and relieved with easy banter for the weaker
but less knavish followers, it seemed to me that one might possibly
get command over this wild herd, and bring them into training, at
least. All I could now do was to walk up to
Blanche&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Mademoiselle de Melcy, a young
baronne&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the eldest, tallest, handsomest, and
most vicious&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stand before her desk, take from
under her hand her exercise-book, remount the estrade, deliberately
read the composition, which I found very stupid, and, as
deliberately, and in the face of the whole school, tear the blotted
page in two.</p>
<p id="id00648">This action availed to draw attention and check
noise. One girl alone, quite in the background, persevered in the
riot with undiminished energy. I looked at her attentively. She had
a pale face, hair like night, broad strong eyebrows, decided
features, and a dark, mutinous, sinister eye: I noted that she sat
close by a little door, which door, I was well aware, opened into a
small closet where books were kept. She was standing up for the
purpose of conducting her clamour with freer energies. I measured
her stature and calculated her strength She seemed both tall and
wiry; but, so the conflict were brief and the attack unexpected, I
thought I might manage her.</p>
<p id="id00649">Advancing up the room, looking as cool and careless
as I possibly could, in short, <i>ayant l'air de rien</i>, I
slightly pushed the door and found it was ajar. In an instant, and
with sharpness, I had turned on her. In another instant she
occupied the closet, the door was shut, and the key in my
pocket.</p>
<p id="id00650">It so happened that this girl, Dolores by name, and
a Catalonian by race, was the sort of character at once dreaded and
hated by all her associates; the act of summary justice above noted
proved popular: there was not one present but, in her heart, liked
to see it done. They were stilled for a moment; then a
smile&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not a laugh&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;passed from
desk to desk: then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when I had gravely and
tranquilly returned to the estrade, courteously requested silence,
and commenced a dictation as if nothing at all had
happened&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the pens travelled peacefully over the
pages, and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and
industry.</p>
<p id="id00651">"C'est bien," said Madame Beck, when I came out of
class, hot and a little exhausted. "Ca ira."</p>
<p id="id00652">She had been listening and peeping through a
spy-hole the whole time.</p>
<p id="id00653">From that day I ceased to be nursery governess, and
became English teacher. Madame raised my salary; but she got thrice
the work out of me she had extracted from Mr. Wilson, at half the
expense.</p>
<h2 id="id00654" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h5 id="id00655">ISIDORE.</h5>
<p id="id00656" style="margin-top: 2em">My time was now well and
profitably filled up. What with teaching others and studying
closely myself, I had hardly a spare moment. It was pleasant. I
felt I was getting, on; not lying the stagnant prey of mould and
rust, but polishing my faculties and whetting them to a keen edge
with constant use. Experience of a certain kind lay before me, on
no narrow scale. Villette is a cosmopolitan city, and in this
school were girls of almost every European nation, and likewise of
very varied rank in life. Equality is much practised in
Labassecour; though not republican in form, it is nearly so in
substance, and at the desks of Madame Beck's establishment the
young countess and the young bourgeoise sat side by side. Nor could
you always by outward indications decide which was noble and which
plebeian; except that, indeed, the latter had often franker and
more courteous manners, while the former bore away the bell for a
delicately-balanced combination of insolence and deceit. In the
former there was often quick French blood mixed with the
marsh-phlegm: I regret to say that the effect of this vivacious
fluid chiefly appeared in the oilier glibness with which flattery
and fiction ran from the tongue, and in a manner lighter and
livelier, but quite heartless and insincere.</p>
<p id="id00657">To do all parties justice, the honest aboriginal
Labassecouriennes had an hypocrisy of their own, too; but it was of
a coarse order, such as could deceive few. Whenever a lie was
necessary for their occasions, they brought it out with a careless
ease and breadth altogether untroubled by the rebuke of conscience.
Not a soul in Madame Beck's house, from the scullion to the
directress herself, but was above being ashamed of a lie; they
thought nothing of it: to invent might not be precisely a virtue,
but it was the most venial of faults. "J'ai menti plusieurs fois,"
formed an item of every girl's and woman's monthly confession: the
priest heard unshocked, and absolved unreluctant. If they had
missed going to mass, or read a chapter of a novel, that was
another thing: these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were
the unfailing weed.</p>
<p id="id00658">While yet but half-conscious of this state of
things, and unlearned in its results, I got on in my new sphere
very well. After the first few difficult lessons, given amidst
peril and on the edge of a moral volcano that rumbled under my feet
and sent sparks and hot fumes into my eyes, the eruptive spirit
seemed to subside, as far as I was concerned. My mind was a good
deal bent on success: I could not bear the thought of being baffled
by mere undisciplined disaffection and wanton indocility, in this
first attempt to get on in life. Many hours of the night I used to
lie awake, thinking what plan I had best adopt to get a reliable
hold on these mutineers, to bring this stiff-necked tribe under
permanent influence. In, the first place, I saw plainly that aid in
no shape was to be expected from Madame: her righteous plan was to
maintain an unbroken popularity with the pupils, at any and every
cost of justice or comfort to the teachers. For a teacher to seek
her alliance in any crisis of insubordination was equivalent to
securing her own expulsion. In intercourse with her pupils, Madame
only took to herself what was pleasant, amiable, and
recommendatory; rigidly requiring of her lieutenants sufficiency
for every annoying crisis, where to act with adequate promptitude
was to be unpopular. Thus, I must look only to myself.</p>
<p id="id00659">Imprimis&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it was clear as the day
that this swinish multitude were not to be driven by force. They
were to be humoured, borne with very patiently: a courteous though
sedate manner impressed them; a very rare flash of raillery did
good. Severe or continuous mental application they could not, or
would not, bear: heavy demand on the memory, the reason, the
attention, they rejected point-blank. Where an English girl of not
more than average capacity and docility would quietly take a theme
and bind herself to the task of comprehension and mastery, a
Labassecourienne would laugh in your face, and throw it back to you
with the phrase,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Dieu, que c'est difficile! Je
n'en veux pas. Cela m'ennuie trop."</p>
<p id="id00660">A teacher who understood her business would take it
back at once, without hesitation, contest, or
expostulation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;proceed with even exaggerated care
to smoothe every difficulty, to reduce it to the level of their
understandings, return it to them thus modified, and lay on the
lash of sarcasm with unsparing hand. They would feel the sting,
perhaps wince a little under it; but they bore no malice against
this sort of attack, provided the sneer was not <i>sour</i>, but
<i>hearty</i>, and that it held well up to them, in a clear, light,
and bold type, so that she who ran might read, their incapacity,
ignorance, and sloth. They would riot for three additional lines to
a lesson; but I never knew them rebel against a wound given to
their self-respect: the little they had of that quality was trained
to be crushed, and it rather liked the pressure of a firm heel than
otherwise.</p>
<p id="id00661">By degrees, as I acquired fluency and freedom in
their language, and could make such application of its more nervous
idioms as suited their case, the elder and more intelligent girls
began rather to like me in their way: I noticed that whenever a
pupil had been roused to feel in her soul the stirring of worthy
emulation, or the quickening of honest shame, from that date she
was won. If I could but once make their (usually large) ears burn
under their thick glossy hair, all was comparatively well.
By-and-by bouquets began to be laid on my desk in the morning; by
way of acknowledgment for this little foreign attention, I used
sometimes to walk with a select few during recreation. In the
course of conversation it befel once or twice that I made an
unpremeditated attempt to rectify some of their singularly
distorted notions of principle; especially I expressed my ideas of
the evil and baseness of a lie. In an unguarded moment, I chanced
to say that, of the two errors; I considered falsehood worse than
an occasional lapse in church-attendance. The poor girls were
tutored to report in Catholic ears whatever the Protestant teacher
said. An edifying consequence ensued.
Something&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an unseen, an indefinite, a
nameless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something stole between myself and
these my best pupils: the bouquets continued to be offered, but
conversation thenceforth became impracticable. As I paced the
alleys or sat in the berceau, a girl never came to my right hand
but a teacher, as if by magic, appeared at my left. Also, wonderful
to relate, Madame's shoes of silence brought her continually to my
back, as quick, as noiseless and unexpected, as some wandering
zephyr.</p>
<p id="id00662">The opinion of my Catholic acquaintance concerning
my spiritual prospects was somewhat na&Atilde;&macr;vely expressed
to me on one occasion. A pensionnaire, to whom I had rendered some
little service, exclaimed one day as she sat beside me:
"Mademoiselle, what a pity you are a Protestant!"</p>
<p id="id00663">"Why, Isabelle?"</p>
<p id="id00664">"Parceque, quand vous serez
morte&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;vous br&Atilde;&raquo;lerez tout de suite
dans l'Enfer."</p>
<p id="id00665">"Croyez-vous?"</p>
<p id="id00666">"Certainement que j'y crois: tout le monde le sait;
et d'ailleurs le pr&Atilde;&ordf;tre me l'a dit."</p>
<p id="id00667">Isabelle was an odd, blunt little creature. She
added, <i>sotto voce</i>: "Pour assurer votre salut
l&Atilde;&nbsp;-haut, on ferait bien de vous br&Atilde;&raquo;ler
toute vive ici-bas."</p>
<p id="id00668">I laughed, as, indeed, it was impossible to do
otherwise.</p>
<p id="id00669">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id00670">Has the reader forgotten Miss Ginevra Fanshawe? If
so, I must be allowed to re-introduce that young lady as a thriving
pupil of Madame Beck's; for such she was. On her arrival in the Rue
Fossette, two or three days after my sudden settlement there, she
encountered me with very little surprise. She must have had good
blood in her veins, for never was any duchess more perfectly,
radically, unaffectedly <i>nonchalante</i> than she: a weak,
transient amaze was all she knew of the sensation of wonder. Most
of her other faculties seemed to be in the same flimsy condition:
her liking and disliking, her love and hate, were mere cobweb and
gossamer; but she had one thing about her that seemed strong and
durable enough, and that was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her
selfishness.</p>
<p id="id00671">She was not proud; and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>bonne
d'enfants</i> as I was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she would forthwith have
made of me a sort of friend and confidant. She teased me with a
thousand vapid complaints about school-quarrels and household
economy: the cookery was not to her taste; the people about her,
teachers and pupils, she held to be despicable, because they were
foreigners. I bore with her abuse of the Friday's salt fish and
hard eggs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with her invective against the soup,
the bread, the coffee&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with some patience for a
time; but at last, wearied by iteration, I turned crusty, and put
her to rights: a thing I ought to have done in the very beginning,
for a salutary setting down always agreed with her.</p>
<p id="id00672">Much longer had I to endure her demands on me in
the way of work. Her wardrobe, so far as concerned articles of
external wear, was well and elegantly supplied; but there were
other habiliments not so carefully provided: what she had, needed
frequent repair. She hated needle-drudgery herself, and she would
bring her hose, &amp;c. to me in heaps, to be mended. A compliance
of some weeks threatening to result in the establishment of an
intolerable bore&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I at last distinctly told her
she must make up her mind to mend her own garments. She cried on
receiving this information, and accused me of having ceased to be
her friend; but I held by my decision, and let the hysterics pass
as they could.</p>
<p id="id00673">Notwithstanding these foibles, and various others
needless to mention&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but by no means of a refined
or elevating character&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how pretty she was! How
charming she looked, when she came down on a sunny Sunday morning,
well-dressed and well-humoured, robed in pale lilac silk, and with
her fair long curls reposing on her white shoulders. Sunday was a
holiday which she always passed with friends resident in town; and
amongst these friends she speedily gave me to understand was one
who would fain become something more. By glimpses and hints it was
shown me, and by the general buoyancy of her look and manner it was
ere long proved, that ardent admiration&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps
genuine love&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was at her command. She called her
suitor "Isidore:" this, however, she intimated was not his real
name, but one by which it pleased her to baptize
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his own, she hinted, not being "very
pretty." Once, when she had been bragging about the vehemence of
"Isidore's" attachment, I asked if she loved him in return.</p>
<p id="id00674">"Comme cela," said she: "he is handsome, and he
loves me to distraction, so that I am well amused. Ca suffit."</p>
<p id="id00675">Finding that she carried the thing on longer than,
from her very fickle tastes, I had anticipated, I one day took it
upon me to make serious inquiries as to whether the gentleman was
such as her parents, and especially her uncle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on
whom, it appeared, she was dependent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;would be
likely to approve. She allowed that this was very doubtful, as she
did not believe "Isidore" had much money.</p>
<p id="id00676">"Do you encourage him?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id00677">"Furieusement sometimes," said she.</p>
<p id="id00678">"Without being certain that you will be permitted
to marry him?"</p>
<p id="id00679">"Oh, how dowdyish you are! I don't want to be
married. I am too young."</p>
<p id="id00680">"But if he loves you as much as you say, and yet it
comes to nothing in the end, he will be made miserable."</p>
<p id="id00681">"Of course he will break his heart. I should be
shocked and, disappointed if he didn't."</p>
<p id="id00682">"I wonder whether this M. Isidore is a fool?" said
I.</p>
<p id="id00683">"He is, about me; but he is wise in other things,
&Atilde;&nbsp; ce qu'on dit. Mrs. Cholmondeley considers him
extremely clever: she says he will push his way by his talents; all
I know is, that he does little more than sigh in my presence, and
that I can wind him round my little finger."</p>
<p id="id00684">Wishing to get a more definite idea of this
love-stricken M. Isidore; whose position seemed to me of the least
secure, I requested her to favour me with a personal description;
but she could not describe: she had neither words nor the power of
putting them together so as to make graphic phrases. She even
seemed not properly to have noticed him: nothing of his looks, of
the changes in his countenance, had touched her heart or dwelt in
her memory&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that he was "beau, mais
plut&Atilde;&acute;t bel homme que joli gar&Atilde;&sect;on," was
all she could assert. My patience would often have failed, and my
interest flagged, in listening to her, but for one thing. All the
hints she dropped, all the details she gave, went unconsciously to
prove, to my thinking, that M. Isidore's homage was offered with
great delicacy and respect. I informed her very plainly that I
believed him much too good for her, and intimated with equal
plainness my impression that she was but a vain coquette. She
laughed, shook her curls from her eyes, and danced away as if I had
paid her a compliment.</p>
<p id="id00685">Miss Ginevra's school-studies were little better
than nominal; there were but three things she practised in earnest,
viz. music, singing, and dancing; also embroidering the fine
cambric handkerchiefs which she could not afford to buy ready
worked: such mere trifles as lessons in history, geography,
grammar, and arithmetic, she left undone, or got others to do for
her. Very much of her time was spent in visiting. Madame, aware
that her stay at school was now limited to a certain period, which
would not be extended whether she made progress or not, allowed her
great licence in this particular. Mrs.
Cholmondeley&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her
<i>chaperon</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a gay, fashionable lady, invited
her whenever she had company at her own house, and sometimes took
her to evening-parties at the houses of her acquaintance. Ginevra
perfectly approved this mode of procedure: it had but one
inconvenience; she was obliged to be well dressed, and she had not
money to buy variety of dresses. All her thoughts turned on this
difficulty; her whole soul was occupied with expedients for
effecting its solution. It was wonderful to witness the activity of
her otherwise indolent mind on this point, and to see the
much-daring intrepidity to which she was spurred by a sense of
necessity, and the wish to shine.</p>
<p id="id00686">She begged boldly of Mrs.
Cholmondeley&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;boldly, I say: not with an air of
reluctant shame, but in this strain:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id00687">"My darling Mrs. C., I have nothing in the world
fit to wear for your party next week; you <i>must</i> give me a
book-muslin dress, and then a <i>ceinture bleu celeste</i>:
<i>do</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there's an angel! will you?"</p>
<p id="id00688">The "darling Mrs. C." yielded at first; but finding
that applications increased as they were complied with, she was
soon obliged, like all Miss Fanshawe's friends, to oppose
resistance to encroachment. After a while I heard no more of Mrs.
Cholmondeley's presents; but still, visiting went on, and the
absolutely necessary dresses continued to be supplied: also many
little expensive <i>etcetera</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gloves,
bouquets, even trinkets. These things, contrary to her custom, and
even nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for she was not
secretive&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were most sedulously kept out of sight
for a time; but one evening, when she was going to a large party
for which particular care and elegance of costume were demanded,
she could not resist coming to my chamber to show herself in all
her splendour.</p>
<p id="id00689">Beautiful she looked: so young, so fresh, and with
a delicacy of skin and flexibility of shape altogether English, and
not found in the list of continental female charms. Her dress was
new, costly, and perfect. I saw at a glance that it lacked none of
those finishing details which cost so much, and give to the general
effect such an air of tasteful completeness.</p>
<p id="id00690">I viewed her from top to toe. She turned airily
round that I might survey her on all sides. Conscious of her
charms, she was in her best humour: her rather small blue eyes
sparkled gleefully. She was going to bestow on me a kiss, in her
school-girl fashion of showing her delights but I said, "Steady!
Let us be Steady, and know what we are about, and find out the
meaning of our magnificence"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and so put her off
at arm's length, to undergo cooler inspection.</p>
<p id="id00691">"Shall I do?" was her question.</p>
<p id="id00692">"Do?" said I. "There are different ways of doing;
and, by my word, I don't understand yours."</p>
<p id="id00693">"But how do I look?"</p>
<p id="id00694">"You look well dressed."</p>
<p id="id00695">She thought the praise not warm enough, and
proceeded to direct attention to the various decorative points of
her attire. "Look at this <i>parure</i>," said she. "The brooch,
the ear-rings, the bracelets: no one in the school has such a
set&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not Madame herself."</p>
<p id="id00696">"I see them all." (Pause.) "Did M. de Bassompierre
give you those jewels?"</p>
<p id="id00697">"My uncle knows nothing about them."</p>
<p id="id00698">"Were they presents from Mrs. Cholmondeley?"</p>
<p id="id00699">"Not they, indeed. Mrs. Cholmondeley is a mean,
stingy creature; she never gives me anything now."</p>
<p id="id00700">I did not choose to ask any further questions, but
turned abruptly away.</p>
<p id="id00701">"Now, old Crusty&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;old Diogenes"
(these were her familiar terms for me when we disagreed), "what is
the matter now?"</p>
<p id="id00702">"Take yourself away. I have no pleasure in looking
at you or your <i>parure</i>."</p>
<p id="id00703">For an instant, she seemed taken by surprise.</p>
<p id="id00704">"What now, Mother Wisdom? I have not got into debt
for it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is, not for the jewels, nor the
gloves, nor the bouquet. My dress is certainly not paid for, but
uncle de Bassompierre will pay it in the bill: he never notices
items, but just looks at the total; and he is so rich, one need not
care about a few guineas more or less."</p>
<p id="id00705">"Will you go? I want to shut the
door&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. Ginevra, people may tell you you are
very handsome in that ball-attire; but, in <i>my</i> eyes, you will
never look so pretty as you did in the gingham gown and plain straw
bonnet you wore when I first saw you."</p>
<p id="id00706">"Other people have not your puritanical tastes,"
was her angry reply.<br />
"And, besides, I see no right you have to sermonize me."<br /></p>
<p id="id00707">"Certainly! I have little right; and you, perhaps,
have still less to come flourishing and fluttering into my
chamber&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a mere jay in borrowed plumes. I have
not the least respect for your feathers, Miss Fanshawe; and
especially the peacock's eyes you call a <i>parure</i>: very pretty
things, if you had bought them with money which was your own, and
which you could well spare, but not at all pretty under present
circumstances."</p>
<p id="id00708">"On est l&Atilde;&nbsp; pour Mademoiselle
Fanshawe!" was announced by the portress, and away she tripped.</p>
<p id="id00709">This semi-mystery of the <i>parure</i> was not
solved till two or three days afterwards, when she came to make a
voluntary confession.</p>
<p id="id00710">"You need not be sulky with me," she began, "in the
idea that I am running somebody, papa or M. de Bassompierre, deeply
into debt. I assure you nothing remains unpaid for, but the few
dresses I have lately had: all the rest is settled."</p>
<p id="id00711">"There," I thought, "lies the mystery; considering
that they were not given you by Mrs. Cholmondeley, and that your
own means are limited to a few shillings, of which I know you to be
excessively careful."</p>
<p id="id00712">"Ecoutez!" she went on, drawing near and speaking
in her most confidential and coaxing tone; for my "sulkiness" was
inconvenient to her: she liked me to be in a talking and listening
mood, even if I only talked to chide and listened to rail.
"Ecoutez, ch&Atilde;&uml;re grogneuse! I will tell you all how and
about it; and you will then see, not only how right the whole thing
is, but how cleverly managed. In the first place, I <i>must</i> go
out. Papa himself said that he wished me to see something of the
world; he particularly remarked to Mrs. Cholmondeley, that, though
I was a sweet creature enough, I had rather a
bread-and-butter-eating, school-girl air; of which it was his
special desire that I should get rid, by an introduction to society
here, before I make my regular d&Atilde;&copy;but in England. Well,
then, if I go out, I <i>must</i> dress. Mrs. Cholmondeley is turned
shabby, and will give nothing more; it would be too hard upon uncle
to make him pay for <i>all</i> the things I need: <i>that</i> you
can't deny&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>that</i> agrees with your own
preachments. Well, but SOMEBODY who heard me (quite by chance, I
assure you) complaining to Mrs. Cholmondeley of my distressed
circumstances, and what straits I was put to for an ornament or
two&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>somebody</i>, far from grudging one a
present, was quite delighted at the idea of being permitted to
offer some trifle. You should have seen what a <i>blanc-bec</i> he
looked when he first spoke of it: how he hesitated and blushed, and
positively trembled from fear of a repulse."</p>
<p id="id00713">"That will do, Miss Fanshawe. I suppose I am to
understand that M. Isidore is the benefactor: that it is from him
you have accepted that costly <i>parure</i>; that he supplies your
bouquets and your gloves?"</p>
<p id="id00714">"You express yourself so disagreeably," said she,
"one hardly knows how to answer; what I mean to say is, that I
occasionally allow Isidore the pleasure and honour of expressing
his homage by the offer of a trifle."</p>
<p id="id00715">"It comes to the same thing&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.
Now, Ginevra, to speak the plain truth, I don't very well
understand these matters; but I believe you are doing very
wrong&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;seriously wrong. Perhaps, however, you now
feel certain that you will be able to marry M. Isidore; your
parents and uncle have given their consent, and, for your part, you
love him entirely?"</p>
<p id="id00716">"Mais pas du tout!" (she always had recourse to
French when about to say something specially heartless and
perverse). "Je suis sa reine, mais il n'est pas mon roi."</p>
<p id="id00717">"Excuse me, I must believe this language is mere
nonsense and coquetry.<br />
There is nothing great about you, yet you are above profiting by
the<br />
good nature and purse of a man to whom you feel absolute
indifference.<br />
You love M. Isidore far more than you think, or will
avow."<br /></p>
<p id="id00718">"No. I danced with a young officer the other night,
whom I love a thousand times more than he. I often wonder why I
feel so very cold to Isidore, for everybody says he is handsome,
and other ladies admire him; but, somehow, he bores me: let me see
now how it is&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."</p>
<p id="id00719">And she seemed to make an effort to reflect. In
this I encouraged her.</p>
<p id="id00720">"Yes!" I said, "try to get a clear idea of the
state of your mind. To me it seems in a great
mess&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;chaotic as a rag-bag."</p>
<p id="id00721">"It is something in this fashion," she cried out
ere long: "the man is too romantic and devoted, and he expects
something more of me than I find it convenient to be. He thinks I
am perfect: furnished with all sorts of sterling qualities and
solid virtues, such as I never had, nor intend to have. Now, one
can't help, in his presence, rather trying to justify his good
opinion; and it does so tire one to be goody, and to talk
sense,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for he really thinks I am sensible. I am
far more at my ease with you, old lady&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you, you
dear crosspatch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who take me at my lowest, and
know me to be coquettish, and ignorant, and flirting, and fickle,
and silly, and selfish, and all the other sweet things you and I
have agreed to be a part of my character."</p>
<p id="id00722">"This is all very well," I said, making a strenuous
effort to preserve that gravity and severity which ran risk of
being shaken by this whimsical candour, "but it does not alter that
wretched business of the presents. Pack them up, Ginevra, like a
good, honest girl, and send them back."</p>
<p id="id00723">"Indeed, I won't," said she, stoutly.</p>
<p id="id00724">"Then you are deceiving M. Isidore. It stands to
reason that by accepting his presents you give him to understand he
will one day receive an equivalent, in your
regard&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;"</p>
<p id="id00725">"But he won't," she interrupted: "he has his
equivalent now, in the pleasure of seeing me wear
them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quite enough for him: he is only
bourgeois."</p>
<p id="id00726">This phrase, in its senseless arrogance, quite
cured me of the temporary weakness which had made me relax my tone
and aspect. She rattled on:</p>
<p id="id00727">"My present business is to enjoy youth, and not to
think of fettering myself, by promise or vow, to this man or that.
When first I saw Isidore, I believed he would help me to enjoy it I
believed he would be content with my being a pretty girl; and that
we should meet and part and flutter about like two butterflies, and
be happy. Lo, and behold! I find him at times as grave as a judge,
and deep-feeling and thoughtful. Bah! Les penseurs, les hommes
profonds et passionn&Atilde;&copy;s ne sont pas &Atilde;&nbsp; mon
go&Atilde;&raquo;t. Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far better.
Va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons! Vive les joies et les
plaisirs! A bas les grandes passions et les
s&Atilde;&copy;v&Atilde;&uml;res vertus!"</p>
<p id="id00728">She looked for an answer to this tirade. I gave
none.</p>
<p id="id00729">"J'aime mon beau Colonel," she went on: "je
n'aimerai jamais son rival.<br />
Je ne serai jamais femme de bourgeois, moi!"<br /></p>
<p id="id00730">I now signified that it was imperatively necessary
my apartment should be relieved of the honour of her presence: she
went away laughing.</p>
<h2 id="id00731" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h5 id="id00732">DR JOHN.</h5>
<p id="id00733" style="margin-top: 2em">Madame Beck was a most
consistent character; forbearing with all the world, and tender to
no part of it. Her own children drew her into no deviation from the
even tenor of her stoic calm. She was solicitous about her family,
vigilant for their interests and physical well-being; but she never
seemed to know the wish to take her little children upon her lap,
to press their rosy lips with her own, to gather them in a genial
embrace, to shower on them softly the benignant caress, the loving
word.</p>
<p id="id00734">I have watched her sometimes sitting in the garden,
viewing the little bees afar off, as they walked in a distant alley
with Trinette, their <i>bonne</i>; in her mien spoke care and
prudence. I know she often pondered anxiously what she called "leur
avenir;" but if the youngest, a puny and delicate but engaging
child, chancing to spy her, broke from its nurse, and toddling down
the walk, came all eager and laughing and panting to clasp her
knee, Madame would just calmly put out one hand, so as to prevent
inconvenient concussion from the child's sudden onset: "Prends
garde, mon enfant!" she would say unmoved, patiently permit it to
stand near her a few moments, and then, without smile or kiss, or
endearing syllable, rise and lead it back to Trinette.</p>
<p id="id00735">Her demeanour to the eldest girl was equally
characteristic in another way. This was a vicious child. "Quelle
peste que cette D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e! Quel poison que
cet enfant l&Atilde;&nbsp;!" were the expressions dedicated to her,
alike in kitchen and in schoolroom. Amongst her other endowments
she boasted an exquisite skill in the art, of provocation,
sometimes driving her <i>bonne</i> and the servants almost wild.
She would steal to their attics, open their drawers and boxes,
wantonly tear their best caps and soil their best shawls; she would
watch her opportunity to get at the buffet of the
salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger, where she would smash articles of
porcelain or glass&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or to the cupboard of the
storeroom, where she would plunder the preserves, drink the sweet
wine, break jars and bottles, and so contrive as to throw the onus
of suspicion on the cook and the kitchen-maid. All this when Madame
saw, and of which when she received report, her sole observation,
uttered with matchless serenity, was:</p>
<p id="id00736">"D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e a besoin d'une
surveillance toute particuli&Atilde;&uml;re." Accordingly she kept
this promising olive-branch a good deal at her side. Never once, I
believe, did she tell her faithfully of her faults, explain the
evil of such habits, and show the results which must thence ensue.
Surveillance must work the whole cure. It failed of course.
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e was kept in some measure from the
servants, but she teased and pillaged her mamma instead. Whatever
belonging to Madame's work-table or toilet she could lay her hands
on, she stole and hid. Madame saw all this, but she still pretended
not to see: she had not rectitude of soul to confront the child
with her vices. When an article disappeared whose value rendered
restitution necessary, she would profess to think that
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e had taken it away in play, and
beg her to restore it. D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e was not to
be so cheated: she had learned to bring falsehood to the aid of
theft, and would deny having touched the brooch, ring, or scissors.
Carrying on the hollow system, the mother would calmly assume an
air of belief, and afterwards ceaselessly watch and dog the child
till she tracked her: to her hiding-places&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some
hole in the garden-wall&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some chink or cranny in
garret or out-house. This done, Madame would send
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e out for a walk with her
<i>bonne</i>, and profit by her absence to rob the robber.
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e proved herself the true daughter
of her astute parent, by never suffering either her countenance or
manner to betray the least sign of mortification on discovering the
loss.</p>
<p id="id00737">The second child, Fifine, was said to be like its
dead father. Certainly, though the mother had given it her healthy
frame, her blue eye and ruddy cheek, not from her was derived its
moral being. It was an honest, gleeful little soul: a passionate,
warm-tempered, bustling creature it was too, and of the sort likely
to blunder often into perils and difficulties. One day it bethought
itself to fall from top to bottom of a steep flight of stone steps;
and when Madame, hearing the noise (she always heard every noise),
issued from the salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger and picked it up, she
said quietly,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Cet enfant a un os
cass&Atilde;&copy;."</p>
<p id="id00738">At first we hoped this was not the case. It was,
however, but too true: one little plump arm hung powerless.</p>
<p id="id00739">"Let Meess" (meaning me) "take her," said Madame;
"et qu'on aille tout de suite chercher un fiacre."</p>
<p id="id00740">In a <i>fiacre</i> she promptly, but with admirable
coolness and self-possession, departed to fetch a surgeon.</p>
<p id="id00741">It appeared she did not find the family-surgeon at
home; but that mattered not: she sought until she laid her hand on
a substitute to her mind, and brought him back with her. Meantime I
had cut the child's sleeve from its arm, undressed and put it to
bed.</p>
<p id="id00742">We none of us, I suppose (by <i>we</i> I mean the
bonne, the cook, the portress, and myself, all which personages
were now gathered in the small and heated chamber), looked very
scrutinizingly at the new doctor when he came into the room. I, at
least, was taken up with endeavouring to soothe Fifine; whose cries
(for she had good lungs) were appalling to hear. These cries
redoubled in intensity as the stranger approached her bed; when he
took her up, "Let alone!" she cried passionately, in her broken
English (for she spoke English as did the other children). "I will
not you: I will Dr. Pillule!"</p>
<p id="id00743">"And Dr. Pillule is my very good friend," was the
answer, in perfect English; "but he is busy at a place three
leagues off, and I am come in his stead. So now, when we get a
little calmer, we must commence business; and we will soon have
that unlucky little arm bandaged and in right order."</p>
<p id="id00744">Hereupon he called for a glass of <i>eau
sucr&Atilde;&copy;e</i>, fed her with some teaspoonfuls of the
sweet liquid (Fifine was a frank gourmande; anybody could win her
heart through her palate), promised her more when the operation
should be over, and promptly went to work. Some assistance being
needed, he demanded it of the cook, a robust, strong-armed woman;
but she, the portress, and the nurse instantly fled. I did not like
to touch that small, tortured limb, but thinking there was no
alternative, my hand was already extended to do what was requisite.
I was anticipated; Madame Beck had put out her own hand: hers was
steady while mine trembled.</p>
<p id="id00745">"Ca vaudra mieux," said the doctor, turning from me
to her.</p>
<p id="id00746">He showed wisdom in his choice. Mine would have
been feigned stoicism, forced fortitude. Hers was neither forced
nor feigned.</p>
<p id="id00747">"Merci, Madame; tr&Atilde;&uml;s bien, fort bien!"
said the operator when he had finished. "Voil&Atilde;&nbsp; un
sang-froid bien opportun, et qui vaut mille &Atilde;&copy;lans de
sensibilit&Atilde;&copy; d&Atilde;&copy;plac&Atilde;&copy;e."</p>
<p id="id00748">He was pleased with her firmness, she with his
compliment. It was likely, too, that his whole general appearance,
his voice, mien, and manner, wrought impressions in his favour.
Indeed, when you looked well at him, and when a lamp was brought
in&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for it was evening and now waxing
dusk&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you saw that, unless Madame Beck had been
less than woman, it could not well be otherwise. This young doctor
(he <i>was</i> young) had no common aspect. His stature looked
imposingly tall in that little chamber, and amidst that group of
Dutch-made women; his profile was clear, fine and expressive:
perhaps his eye glanced from face to face rather too vividly, too
quickly, and too often; but it had a most pleasant character, and
so had his mouth; his chin was full, cleft, Grecian, and perfect.
As to his smile, one could not in a hurry make up one's mind as to
the descriptive epithet it merited; there was something in it that
pleased, but something too that brought surging up into the mind
all one's foibles and weak points: all that could lay one open to a
laugh. Yet Fifine liked this doubtful smile, and thought the owner
genial: much as he had hurt her, she held out her hand to bid him a
friendly good-night. He patted the little hand kindly, and then he
and Madame went down-stairs together; she talking in her highest
tide of spirits and volubility, he listening with an air of
good-natured amenity, dashed with that unconscious roguish archness
I find it difficult to describe.</p>
<p id="id00749">I noticed that though he spoke French well, he
spoke English better; he had, too, an English complexion, eyes, and
form. I noticed more. As he passed me in leaving the room, turning
his face in my direction one moment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not to
address me, but to speak to Madame, yet so standing, that I almost
necessarily looked up at him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a recollection
which had been struggling to form in my memory, since the first
moment I heard his voice, started up perfected. This was the very
gentleman to whom I had spoken at the bureau; who had helped me in
the matter of the trunk; who had been my guide through the dark,
wet park. Listening, as he passed down the long vestibule out into
the street, I recognised his very tread: it was the same firm and
equal stride I had followed under the dripping trees.</p>
<p id="id00750">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id00751">It was, to be concluded that this young
surgeon-physician's first visit to the Rue Fossette would be the
last. The respectable Dr. Pillule being expected home the next day,
there appeared no reason why his temporary substitute should again
represent him; but the Fates had written their decree to the
contrary.</p>
<p id="id00752">Dr. Pillule had been summoned to see a rich old
hypochondriac at the antique university town of Bouquin-Moisi, and
upon his prescribing change of air and travel as remedies, he was
retained to accompany the timid patient on a tour of some weeks; it
but remained, therefore, for the new doctor to continue his
attendance at the Rue Fossette.</p>
<p id="id00753">I often saw him when he came; for Madame would not
trust the little invalid to Trinette, but required me to spend much
of my time in the nursery. I think he was skilful. Fifine recovered
rapidly under his care, yet even her convalescence did not hasten
his dismissal. Destiny and Madame Beck seemed in league, and both
had ruled that he should make deliberate acquaintance with the
vestibule, the private staircase and upper chambers of the Rue
Fossette.</p>
<p id="id00754">No sooner did Fifine emerge from his hands than
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e declared herself ill. That
possessed child had a genius for simulation, and captivated by the
attentions and indulgences of a sick-room, she came to the
conclusion that an illness would perfectly accommodate her tastes,
and took her bed accordingly. She acted well, and her mother still
better; for while the whole case was transparent to Madame Beck as
the day, she treated it with an astonishingly well-assured air of
gravity and good faith.</p>
<p id="id00755">What surprised me was, that Dr. John (so the young
Englishman had taught Fifine to call him, and we all took from her
the habit of addressing him by this name, till it became an
established custom, and he was known by no other in the Rue
Fossette)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that Dr. John consented tacitly to
adopt Madame's tactics, and to fall in with her manoeuvres. He
betrayed, indeed, a period of comic doubt, cast one or two rapid
glances from the child to the mother, indulged in an interval of
self-consultation, but finally resigned himself with a good grace
to play his part in the farce. D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e
eat like a raven, gambolled day and night in her bed, pitched tents
with the sheets and blankets, lounged like a Turk amidst pillows
and bolsters, diverted herself with throwing her shoes at her bonne
and grimacing at her sisters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;over-flowed, in
short, with unmerited health and evil spirits; only languishing
when her mamma and the physician paid their diurnal visit. Madame
Beck, I knew, was glad, at any price, to have her daughter in bed
out of the way of mischief; but I wondered that Dr. John did not
tire of the business.</p>
<p id="id00756">Every day, on this mere pretext of a motive, he
gave punctual attendance; Madame always received him with the same
empressement, the same sunshine for himself, the same admirably
counterfeited air of concern for her child. Dr. John wrote harmless
prescriptions for the patient, and viewed her mother with a
shrewdly sparkling eye. Madame caught his rallying looks without
resenting them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she had too much good sense for
that. Supple as the young doctor seemed, one could not despise
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this pliant part was evidently not adopted
in the design to curry favour with his employer: while he liked his
office at the pensionnat, and lingered strangely about the Rue
Fossette, he was independent, almost careless in his carriage
there; and yet, too, he was often thoughtful and preoccupied.</p>
<p id="id00757">It was not perhaps my business to observe the
mystery of his bearing, or search out its origin or aim; but,
placed as I was, I could hardly help it. He laid himself open to my
observation, according to my presence in the room just that degree
of notice and consequence a person of my exterior habitually
expects: that is to say, about what is given to unobtrusive
articles of furniture, chairs of ordinary joiner's work, and
carpets of no striking pattern. Often, while waiting for Madame, he
would muse, smile, watch, or listen like a man who thinks himself
alone. I, meantime, was free to puzzle over his countenance and
movements, and wonder what could be the meaning of that peculiar
interest and attachment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all mixed up with doubt
and strangeness, and inexplicably ruled by some presiding
spell&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which wedded him to this demi-convent,
secluded in the built-up core of a capital. He, I believe, never
remembered that I had eyes in my head, much less a brain behind
them.</p>
<p id="id00758">Nor would he ever have found this out, but that one
day, while he sat in the sunshine and I was observing the colouring
of his hair, whiskers, and complexion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the whole
being of such a tone as a strong light brings out with somewhat
perilous force (indeed I recollect I was driven to compare his
beamy head in my thoughts to that of the "golden image" which
Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up), an idea new, sudden, and
startling, riveted my attention with an over-mastering strength and
power of attraction. I know not to this day how I looked at him:
the force of surprise, and also of conviction, made me forget
myself; and I only recovered wonted consciousness when I saw that
his notice was arrested, and that it had caught my movement in a
clear little oval mirror fixed in the side of the window
recess&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;by the aid of which reflector Madame
often secretly spied persons walking in the garden below. Though of
so gay and sanguine a temperament, he was not without a certain
nervous sensitiveness which made him ill at ease under a direct,
inquiring gaze. On surprising me thus, he turned and said, in a
tone which, though courteous, had just so much dryness in it as to
mark a shade of annoyance, as well as to give to what was said the
character of rebuke, "Mademoiselle does not spare me: I am not vain
enough to fancy that it is my merits which attract her attention;
it must then be some defect. Dare I
ask&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what?"</p>
<p id="id00759">I was confounded, as the reader may suppose, yet
not with an irrecoverable confusion; being conscious that it was
from no emotion of incautious admiration, nor yet in a spirit of
unjustifiable inquisitiveness, that I had incurred this reproof. I
might have cleared myself on the spot, but would not. I did not
speak. I was not in the habit of speaking to him. Suffering him,
then, to think what he chose and accuse me of what he would, I
resumed some work I had dropped, and kept my head bent over it
during the remainder of his stay. There is a perverse mood of the
mind which is rather soothed than irritated by misconstruction; and
in quarters where we can never be rightly known, we take pleasure,
I think, in being consummately ignored. What honest man, on being
casually taken for a housebreaker, does not feel rather tickled
than vexed at the mistake?</p>
<h2 id="id00760" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h5 id="id00761">THE PORTRESS'S CABINET.</h5>
<p id="id00762" style="margin-top: 2em">It was summer and very hot.
Georgette, the youngest of Madame Beck's children, took a fever.
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e, suddenly cured of her ailments,
was, together with Fifine, packed off to Bonne-Maman, in the
country, by way of precaution against infection. Medical aid was
now really needed, and Madame, choosing to ignore the return of Dr.
Pillule, who had been at home a week, conjured his English rival to
continue his visits. One or two of the pensionnaires complained of
headache, and in other respects seemed slightly to participate in
Georgette's ailment. "Now, at last," I thought, "Dr. Pillule must
be recalled: the prudent directress will never venture to permit
the attendance of so young a man on the pupils."</p>
<p id="id00763">The directress was very prudent, but she could also
be intrepidly venturous. She actually introduced Dr. John to the
school-division of the premises, and established him in attendance
on the proud and handsome Blanche de Melcy, and the vain, flirting
Ang&Atilde;&copy;lique, her friend. Dr. John, I thought, testified
a certain gratification at this mark of confidence; and if
discretion of bearing could have justified the step, it would by
him have been amply justified. Here, however, in this land of
convents and confessionals, such a presence as his was not to be
suffered with impunity in a "pensionnat de demoiselles." The school
gossiped, the kitchen whispered, the town caught the rumour,
parents wrote letters and paid visits of remonstrance. Madame, had
she been weak, would now have been lost: a dozen rival educational
houses were ready to improve this false step&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if
false step it were&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to her ruin; but Madame was
not weak, and little Jesuit though she might be, yet I clapped the
hands of my heart, and with its voice cried "brava!" as I watched
her able bearing, her skilled management, her temper and her
firmness on this occasion.</p>
<p id="id00764">She met the alarmed parents with a good-humoured,
easy grace for nobody matched her in, I know not whether to say the
possession or the assumption of a certain "rondeur et franchise de
bonne femme;" which on various occasions gained the point aimed at
with instant and complete success, where severe gravity and serious
reasoning would probably have failed.</p>
<p id="id00765">"Ce pauvre Docteur Jean!" she would say, chuckling
and rubbing joyously her fat little white hands; "ce cher jeune
homme! le meilleur cr&Atilde;&copy;ature du monde!" and go on to
explain how she happened to be employing him for her own children,
who were so fond of him they would scream themselves into fits at
the thought of another doctor; how, where she had confidence for
her own, she thought it natural to repose trust for others, and au
reste, it was only the most temporary expedient in the world;
Blanche and Ang&Atilde;&copy;lique had the migraine; Dr. John had
written a prescription; voil&Atilde;&nbsp; tout!</p>
<p id="id00766">The parents' mouths were closed. Blanche and
Ang&Atilde;&copy;lique saved her all remaining trouble by chanting
loud duets in their physician's praise; the other pupils echoed
them, unanimously declaring that when they were ill they would have
Dr. John and nobody else; and Madame laughed, and the parents
laughed too. The Labassecouriens must have a large organ of
philoprogenitiveness: at least the indulgence of offspring is
carried by them to excessive lengths; the law of most households
being the children's will. Madame now got credit for having acted
on this occasion in a spirit of motherly partiality: she came off
with flying colours; people liked her as a directress better than
ever.</p>
<p id="id00767">To this day I never fully understood why she thus
risked her interest for the sake of Dr. John. What people said, of
course I know well: the whole house&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pupils,
teachers, servants included&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;affirmed that she
was going to marry him. So they had settled it; difference of age
seemed to make no obstacle in their eyes: it was to be so.</p>
<p id="id00768">It must be admitted that appearances did not wholly
discountenance this idea; Madame seemed so bent on retaining his
services, so oblivious of her former
prot&Atilde;&copy;g&Atilde;&copy;, Pillule. She made, too, such a
point of personally receiving his visits, and was so unfailingly
cheerful, blithe, and benignant in her manner to him. Moreover, she
paid, about this time, marked attention to dress: the morning
dishabille, the nightcap and shawl, were discarded; Dr. John's
early visits always found her with auburn braids all nicely
arranged, silk dress trimly fitted on, neat laced brodequins in
lieu of slippers: in short the whole toilette complete as a model,
and fresh as a flower. I scarcely think, however, that her
intention in this went further than just to show a very handsome
man that she was not quite a plain woman; and plain she was not.
Without beauty of feature or elegance of form, she pleased. Without
youth and its gay graces, she cheered. One never tired of seeing
her: she was never monotonous, or insipid, or colourless, or flat.
Her unfaded hair, her eye with its temperate blue light, her cheek
with its wholesome fruit-like bloom&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these things
pleased in moderation, but with constancy.</p>
<p id="id00769">Had she, indeed, floating visions of adopting Dr.
John as a husband, taking him to her well-furnished home, endowing
him with her savings, which were said to amount to a moderate
competency, and making him comfortable for the rest of his life?
Did Dr. John suspect her of such visions? I have met him coming out
of her presence with a mischievous half-smile about his lips, and
in his eyes a look as of masculine vanity elate and tickled. With
all his good looks and good-nature, he was not perfect; he must
have been very imperfect if he roguishly encouraged aims he never
intended to be successful. But did he not intend them to be
successful? People said he had no money, that he was wholly
dependent upon his profession. Madame&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though
perhaps some fourteen years his senior&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was yet
the sort of woman never to grow old, never to wither, never to
break down. They certainly were on good terms. <i>He</i> perhaps
was not in love; but how many people ever <i>do</i> love, or at
least marry for love, in this world. We waited the end.</p>
<p id="id00770">For what <i>he</i> waited, I do not know, nor for
what he watched; but the peculiarity of his manner, his expectant,
vigilant, absorbed, eager look, never wore off: it rather
intensified. He had never been quite within the compass of my
penetration, and I think he ranged farther and farther beyond
it.</p>
<p id="id00771">One morning little Georgette had been more feverish
and consequently more peevish; she was crying, and would not be
pacified. I thought a particular draught ordered, disagreed with
her, and I doubted whether it ought to be continued; I waited
impatiently for the doctor's coming in order to consult him.</p>
<p id="id00772">The door-bell rang, he was admitted; I felt sure of
this, for I heard his voice addressing the portress. It was his
custom to mount straight to the nursery, taking about three degrees
of the staircase at once, and coming upon us like a cheerful
surprise. Five minutes
elapsed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ten&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I saw and
heard nothing of him. What could he be doing? Possibly waiting in
the corridor below. Little Georgette still piped her plaintive
wail, appealing to me by her familiar term, "Minnie, Minnie, me
very poorly!" till my heart ached. I descended to ascertain why he
did not come. The corridor was empty. Whither was he vanished? Was
he with Madame in the <i>salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger?</i>
Impossible: I had left her but a short time since, dressing in her
own chamber. I listened. Three pupils were just then hard at work
practising in three proximate rooms&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
dining-room and the greater and lesser drawing-rooms, between which
and the corridor there was but the portress's cabinet communicating
with the salons, and intended originally for a boudoir. Farther
off, at a fourth instrument in the oratory, a whole class of a
dozen or more were taking a singing lesson, and just then joining
in a "barcarole" (I think they called it), whereof I yet remember
these words "fra&Atilde;&reg;ch&Atilde;&laquo;,"
"bris&Atilde;&laquo;," and "Venis&Atilde;&laquo;." Under these
circumstances, what could I hear? A great deal, certainly; had it
only been to the purpose.</p>
<p id="id00773">Yes; I heard a giddy treble laugh in the
above-mentioned little cabinet, close by the door of which I
stood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that door half-unclosed; a man's voice in
a soft, deep, pleading tone, uttered some, words, whereof I only
caught the adjuration, "For God's sake!" Then, after a second's
pause, forth issued Dr. John, his eye full shining, but not with
either joy or triumph; his fair English cheek high-coloured; a
baffled, tortured, anxious, and yet a tender meaning on his
brow.</p>
<p id="id00774">The open door served me as a screen; but had I been
full in his way, I believe he would have passed without seeing me.
Some mortification, some strong vexation had hold of his soul: or
rather, to write my impressions now as I received them at the time
I should say some sorrow, some sense of injustice. I did not so
much think his pride was hurt, as that his affections had been
wounded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;cruelly wounded, it seemed to me. But
who was the torturer? What being in that house had him so much in
her power? Madame I believed to be in her chamber; the room whence
he had stepped was dedicated to the portress's sole use; and she,
Rosine Matou, an unprincipled though pretty little French grisette,
airy, fickle, dressy, vain, and mercenary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it was
not, surely, to <i>her</i> hand he owed the ordeal through which he
seemed to have passed?</p>
<p id="id00775">But while I pondered, her voice, clear, though
somewhat sharp, broke out in a lightsome French song, trilling
through the door still ajar: I glanced in, doubting my senses.
There at the table she sat in a smart dress of "jaconas rose,"
trimming a tiny blond cap: not a living thing save herself was in
the room, except indeed some gold fish in a glass globe, some
flowers in pots, and a broad July sunbeam.</p>
<p id="id00776">Here was a problem: but I must go up-stairs to ask
about the medicine.</p>
<p id="id00777">Dr. John sat in a chair at Georgette's bedside;
Madame stood before him; the little patient had been examined and
soothed, and now lay composed in her crib. Madame Beck, as I
entered, was discussing the physician's own health, remarking on
some real or fancied change in his looks, charging him with
over-work, and recommending rest and change of air. He listened
good-naturedly, but with laughing indifference, telling her that
she was "trop bonne," and that he felt perfectly well. Madame
appealed to me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr. John following her movement
with a slow glance which seemed to express languid surprise at
reference being made to a quarter so insignificant.</p>
<p id="id00778">"What do you think, Miss Lucie?" asked Madame. "Is
he not paler and thinner?"</p>
<p id="id00779">It was very seldom that I uttered more than
monosyllables in Dr. John's presence; he was the kind of person
with whom I was likely ever to remain the neutral, passive thing he
thought me. Now, however, I took licence to answer in a phrase: and
a phrase I purposely made quite significant.</p>
<p id="id00780">"He looks ill at this moment; but perhaps it is
owing to some temporary cause: Dr. John may have been vexed or
harassed." I cannot tell how he took this speech, as I never sought
his face for information. Georgette here began to ask me in her
broken English if she might have a glass of <i>eau
sucr&Atilde;&copy;e</i>. I answered her in English. For the first
time, I fancy, he noticed that I spoke his language; hitherto he
had always taken me for a foreigner, addressing me as
"Mademoiselle," and giving in French the requisite directions about
the children's treatment. He seemed on the point of making a
remark; but thinking better of it, held his tongue.</p>
<p id="id00781">Madame recommenced advising him; he shook his head,
laughing, rose and bid her good-morning, with courtesy, but still
with the regardless air of one whom too much unsolicited attention
was surfeiting and spoiling.</p>
<p id="id00782">When he was gone, Madame dropped into the chair he
had just left; she rested her chin in her hand; all that was
animated and amiable vanished from her face: she looked stony and
stern, almost mortified and morose. She sighed; a single, but a
deep sigh. A loud bell rang for morning-school. She got up; as she
passed a dressing-table with a glass upon it, she looked at her
reflected image. One single white hair streaked her nut-brown
tresses; she plucked it out with a shudder. In the full summer
daylight, her face, though it still had the colour, could plainly
be seen to have lost the texture of youth; and then, where were
youth's contours? Ah, Madame! wise as you were, even <i>you</i>
knew weakness. Never had I pitied Madame before, but my heart
softened towards her, when she turned darkly from the glass. A
calamity had come upon her. That hag Disappointment was greeting
her with a grisly "All-hail," and her soul rejected the
intimacy.</p>
<p id="id00783">But Rosine! My bewilderment there surpasses
description. I embraced five opportunities of passing her cabinet
that day, with a view to contemplating her charms, and finding out
the secret of their influence. She was pretty, young, and wore a
well-made dress. All very good points, and, I suppose, amply
sufficient to account, in any philosophic mind, for any amount of
agony and distraction in a young man, like Dr. John. Still, I could
not help forming half a wish that the said doctor were my brother;
or at least that he had a sister or a mother who would kindly
sermonize him. I say <i>half</i> a wish; I broke it, and flung it
away before it became a whole one, discovering in good time its
exquisite folly. "Somebody," I argued, "might as well sermonize
Madame about her young physician: and what good would that do?"</p>
<p id="id00784">I believe Madame sermonized herself. She did not
behave weakly, or make herself in any shape ridiculous. It is true
she had neither strong feelings to overcome, nor tender feelings by
which to be miserably pained. It is true likewise that she had an
important avocation, a real business to fill her time, divert her
thoughts, and divide her interest. It is especially true that she
possessed a genuine good sense which is not given to all women nor
to all men; and by dint of these combined advantages she behaved
wisely&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she behaved well. Brava! once more,
Madame Beck. I saw you matched against an Apollyon of a
predilection; you fought a good fight, and you overcame!</p>
<h2 id="id00785" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h5 id="id00786">THE CASKET.</h5>
<p id="id00787" style="margin-top: 2em">Behind the house at the Rue
Fossette there was a garden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;large, considering
that it lay in the heart of a city, and to my recollection at this
day it seems pleasant: but time, like distance, lends to certain
scenes an influence so softening; and where all is stone around,
blank wall and hot pavement, how precious seems one shrub, how
lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground!</p>
<p id="id00788">There went a tradition that Madame Beck's house had
in old days been a convent. That in years gone
by&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how long gone by I cannot tell, but I think
some centuries&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;before the city had over-spread
this quarter, and when it was tilled ground and avenue, and such
deep and leafy seclusion as ought to embosom a religious house-that
something had happened on this site which, rousing fear and
inflicting horror, had left to the place the inheritance of a
ghost-story. A vague tale went of a black and white nun, sometimes,
on some night or nights of the year, seen in some part of this
vicinage. The ghost must have been built out some ages ago, for
there were houses all round now; but certain convent-relics, in the
shape of old and huge fruit-trees, yet consecrated the spot; and,
at the foot of one&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a Methuselah of a pear-tree,
dead, all but a few boughs which still faithfully renewed their
perfumed snow in spring, and their honey-sweet pendants in
autumn&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you saw, in scraping away the mossy earth
between the half-bared roots, a glimpse of slab, smooth, hard, and
black. The legend went, unconfirmed and unaccredited, but still
propagated, that this was the portal of a vault, imprisoning deep
beneath that ground, on whose surface grass grew and flowers
bloomed, the bones of a girl whom a monkish conclave of the drear
middle ages had here buried alive for some sin against her vow. Her
shadow it was that tremblers had feared, through long generations
after her poor frame was dust; her black robe and white veil that,
for timid eyes, moonlight and shade had mocked, as they fluctuated
in the night-wind through the garden-thicket.</p>
<p id="id00789">Independently of romantic rubbish, however, that
old garden had its charms. On summer mornings I used to rise early,
to enjoy them alone; on summer evenings, to linger solitary, to
keep tryste with the rising moon, or taste one kiss of the evening
breeze, or fancy rather than feel the freshness of dew descending.
The turf was verdant, the gravelled walks were white; sun-bright
nasturtiums clustered beautiful about the roots of the doddered
orchard giants. There was a large berceau, above which spread the
shade of an acacia; there was a smaller, more sequestered bower,
nestled in the vines which ran all along a high and grey wall, and
gathered their tendrils in a knot of beauty, and hung their
clusters in loving profusion about the favoured spot where jasmine
and ivy met and married them.</p>
<p id="id00790">Doubtless at high noon, in the broad, vulgar middle
of the day, when Madame Beck's large school turned out rampant, and
externes and pensionnaires were spread abroad, vying with the
denizens of the boys' college close at hand, in the brazen exercise
of their lungs and limbs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;doubtless <i>then</i>
the garden was a trite, trodden-down place enough. But at sunset or
the hour of <i>salut</i>, when the externes were gone home, and the
boarders quiet at their studies; pleasant was it then to stray down
the peaceful alleys, and hear the bells of St. Jean Baptiste peal
out with their sweet, soft, exalted sound.</p>
<p id="id00791">I was walking thus one evening, and had been
detained farther within the verge of twilight than usual, by the
still-deepening calm, the mellow coolness, the fragrant breathing
with which flowers no sunshine could win now answered the
persuasion of the dew. I saw by a light in the oratory window that
the Catholic household were then gathered to evening
prayer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a rite, from attendance on which, I now
and then, as a Protestant, exempted myself.</p>
<p id="id00792">"One moment longer," whispered solitude and the
summer moon, "stay with us: all is truly quiet now; for another
quarter of an hour your presence will not be missed: the day's heat
and bustle have tired you; enjoy these precious minutes."</p>
<p id="id00793">The windowless backs of houses built in this
garden, and in particular the whole of one side, was skirted by the
rear of a long line of premises&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;being the
boarding-houses of the neighbouring college. This rear, however,
was all blank stone, with the exception of certain attic loopholes
high up, opening from the sleeping-rooms of the women-servants, and
also one casement in a lower story said to mark the chamber or
study of a master. But, though thus secure, an alley, which ran
parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden, was
forbidden to be entered by the pupils. It was called indeed
"l'all&Atilde;&copy;e d&Atilde;&copy;fendue," and any girl setting
foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe a
penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck's establishment permitted.
Teachers might indeed go there with impunity; but as the walk was
narrow, and the neglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on
each side, weaving overhead a roof of branch and leaf which the
sun's rays penetrated but in rare chequers, this alley was seldom
entered even during day, and after dusk was carefully shunned.</p>
<p id="id00794">From the first I was tempted to make an exception
to this rule of avoidance: the seclusion, the very gloom of the
walk attracted me. For a long time the fear of seeming singular
scared me away; but by degrees, as people became accustomed to me
and my habits, and to such shades of peculiarity as were engrained
in my nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shades, certainly not striking
enough to interest, and perhaps not prominent enough to offend, but
born in and with me, and no more to be parted with than my
identity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;by slow degrees I became a frequenter
of this strait and narrow path. I made myself gardener of some
tintless flowers that grew between its closely-ranked shrubs; I
cleared away the relics of past autumns, choking up a rustic seat
at the far end. Borrowing of Goton, the cuisini&Atilde;&uml;re, a
pail of water and a scrubbing-brush, I made this seat clean. Madame
saw me at work and smiled approbation: whether sincerely or not I
don't know; but she <i>seemed</i> sincere.</p>
<p id="id00795">"Voyez-vous," cried she, "comme elle est propre,
cette demoiselle Lucie? Vous aimez done cette all&Atilde;&copy;e,
Meess?" "Yes," I said, "it is quiet and shady."</p>
<p id="id00796">"C'est juste," cried she with an air of
bont&Atilde;&copy;; and she kindly recommended me to confine myself
to it as much as I chose, saying, that as I was not charged with
the surveillance, I need not trouble myself to walk with the
pupils: only I might permit her children to come there, to talk
English with me.</p>
<p id="id00797">On the night in question, I was sitting on the
hidden seat reclaimed from fungi and mould, listening to what
seemed the far-off sounds of the city. Far off, in truth, they were
not: this school was in the city's centre; hence, it was but five
minutes' walk to the park, scarce ten to buildings of palatial
splendour. Quite near were wide streets brightly lit, teeming at
this moment with life: carriages were rolling through them to balls
or to the opera. The same hour which tolled curfew for our convent,
which extinguished each lamp, and dropped the curtain round each
couch, rang for the gay city about us the summons to festal
enjoyment. Of this contrast I thought not, however: gay instincts
my nature had few; ball or opera I had never seen; and though often
I had heard them described, and even wished to see them, it was not
the wish of one who hopes to partake a pleasure if she could only
reach it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who feels fitted to shine in some
bright distant sphere, could she but thither win her way; it was no
yearning to attain, no hunger to taste; only the calm desire to
look on a new thing.</p>
<p id="id00798">A moon was in the sky, not a full moon, but a young
crescent. I saw her through a space in the boughs overhead. She and
the stars, visible beside her, were no strangers where all else was
strange: my childhood knew them. I had seen that golden sign with
the dark globe in its curve leaning back on azure, beside an old
thorn at the top of an old field, in Old England, in long past
days, just as it now leaned back beside a stately spire in this
continental capital.</p>
<p id="id00799">Oh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I
lived, little as I spoke, cold as I looked, when I thought of past
days, I <i>could</i> feel. About the present, it was better to be
stoical; about the future&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such a future as
mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to be dead. And in catalepsy and a dead
trance, I studiously held the quick of my nature.</p>
<p id="id00800">At that time, I well remember whatever could
excite&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;certain accidents of the weather, for
instance, were almost dreaded by me, because they woke the being I
was always lulling, and stirred up a craving cry I could not
satisfy. One night a thunder-storm broke; a sort of hurricane shook
us in our beds: the Catholics rose in panic and prayed to their
saints. As for me, the tempest took hold of me with tyranny: I was
roughly roused and obliged to live. I got up and dressed myself,
and creeping outside the casement close by my bed, sat on its
ledge, with my feet on the roof of a lower adjoining building. It
was wet, it was wild, it was pitch-dark. Within the dormitory they
gathered round the night-lamp in consternation, praying loud. I
could not go in: too resistless was the delight of staying with the
wild hour, black and full of thunder, pealing out such an ode as
language never delivered to man&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too terribly
glorious, the spectacle of clouds, split and pierced by white and
blinding bolts.</p>
<p id="id00801">I did long, achingly, then and for four and twenty
hours afterwards, for something to fetch me out of my present
existence, and lead me upwards and onwards. This longing, and all
of a similar kind, it was necessary to knock on the head; which I
did, figuratively, after the manner of Jael to Sisera, driving a
nail through their temples. Unlike Sisera, they did not die: they
were but transiently stunned, and at intervals would turn on the
nail with a rebellious wrench: then did the temples bleed, and the
brain thrill to its core.</p>
<p id="id00802">To-night, I was not so mutinous, nor so miserable.
My Sisera lay quiet in the tent, slumbering; and if his pain ached
through his slumbers, something like an
angel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the ideal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;knelt near,
dropping balm on the soothed temples, holding before the sealed
eyes a magic glass, of which the sweet, solemn visions were
repeated in dreams, and shedding a reflex from her moonlight wings
and robe over the transfixed sleeper, over the tent threshold, over
all the landscape lying without. Jael, the stern woman; sat apart,
relenting somewhat over her captive; but more prone to dwell on the
faithful expectation of Heber coming home. By which words I mean
that the cool peace and dewy sweetness of the night filled me with
a mood of hope: not hope on any definite point, but a general sense
of encouragement and heart-ease.</p>
<p id="id00803">Should not such a mood, so sweet, so tranquil, so
unwonted, have been the harbinger of good? Alas, no good came of
it! I Presently the rude Real burst coarsely
in&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all evil grovelling and repellent as she too
often is.</p>
<p id="id00804">Amid the intense stillness of that pile of stone
overlooking the walk, the trees, the high wall, I heard a sound; a
casement [all the windows here are casements, opening on hinges]
creaked. Ere I had time to look up and mark where, in which story,
or by whom unclosed, a tree overhead shook, as if struck by a
missile; some object dropped prone at my feet.</p>
<p id="id00805">Nine was striking by St. Jean Baptiste's clock; day
was fading, but it was not dark: the crescent moon aided little,
but the deep gilding of that point in heaven where the sun beamed
last, and the crystalline clearness of a wide space above,
sustained the summer twilight; even in my dark walk I could, by
approaching an opening, have managed to read print of a small type.
Easy was it to see then that the missile was a box, a small box of
white and coloured ivory; its loose lid opened in my hand; violets
lay within, violets smothering a closely folded bit of pink paper,
a note, superscribed, "Pour la robe grise." I wore indeed a dress
of French grey.</p>
<p id="id00806">Good. Was this a billet-doux? A thing I had heard
of, but hitherto had not had the honour of seeing or handling. Was
it this sort of commodity I held between my finger and thumb at
this moment?</p>
<p id="id00807">Scarcely: I did not dream it for a moment. Suitor
or admirer my very thoughts had not conceived. All the teachers had
dreams of some lover; one (but she was naturally of a credulous
turn) believed in a future husband. All the pupils above fourteen
knew of some prospective bridegroom; two or three were already
affianced by their parents, and had been so from childhood: but
into the realm of feelings and hopes which such prospects open, my
speculations, far less my presumptions, had never once had warrant
to intrude. If the other teachers went into town, or took a walk on
the boulevards, or only attended mass, they were very certain
(according to the accounts brought back) to meet with some
individual of the "opposite sex," whose rapt, earnest gaze assured
them of their power to strike and to attract. I can't say that my
experience tallied with theirs, in this respect. I went to church
and I took walks, and am very well convinced that nobody minded me.
There was not a girl or woman in the Rue Fossette who could not,
and did not testify to having received an admiring beam from our
young doctor's blue eyes at one time or other. I am obliged,
however humbling it may sound, to except myself: as far as I was
concerned, those blue eyes were guiltless, and calm as the sky, to
whose tint theirs seemed akin. So it came to pass that I heard the
others talk, wondered often at their gaiety, security, and
self-satisfaction, but did not trouble myself to look up and gaze
along the path they seemed so certain of treading. This then was no
billet-doux; and it was in settled conviction to the contrary that
I quietly opened it. Thus it ran&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
translate:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id00808">"Angel of my dreams! A thousand, thousand thanks
for the promise kept: scarcely did I venture to hope its
fulfilment. I believed you, indeed, to be half in jest; and then
you seemed to think the enterprise beset with such
danger&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the hour so untimely, the alley so
strictly secluded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;often, you said, haunted by
that dragon, the English teacher&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;une
v&Atilde;&copy;ritable b&Atilde;&copy;gueule Britannique
&Atilde;&nbsp; ce que vous
dites&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;esp&Atilde;&uml;ce de monstre, brusque et
rude comme un vieux caporal de grenadiers, et rev&Atilde;&ordf;che
comme une religieuse" (the reader will excuse my modesty in
allowing this flattering sketch of my amiable self to retain the
slight veil of the original tongue). "You are aware," went on this
precious effusion, "that little Gustave, on account of his illness,
has been removed to a master's chamber&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
favoured chamber, whose lattice overlooks your prison-ground.
There, I, the best uncle in the world, am admitted to visit him.
How tremblingly I approached the window and glanced into your
Eden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an Eden for me, though a desert for
you!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how I feared to behold vacancy, or the
dragon aforesaid! How my heart palpitated with delight when,
through apertures in the envious boughs, I at once caught the gleam
of your graceful straw-hat, and the waving of your grey
dress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dress that I should recognise amongst a
thousand. But why, my angel, will you not look up? Cruel, to deny
me one ray of those adorable eyes!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how a single
glance would have revived me! I write this in fiery haste; while
the physician examines Gustave, I snatch an opportunity to enclose
it in a small casket, together with a bouquet of flowers, the
sweetest that blow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;yet less sweet than thee, my
Peri&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my all-charming! ever thine-thou well
knowest whom!"</p>
<p id="id00809">"I wish I did know whom," was my comment; and the
wish bore even closer reference to the person addressed in this
choice document, than to the writer thereof. Perhaps it was from
the fianc&Atilde;&copy; of one of the engaged pupils; and, in that
case, there was no great harm done or
intended&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;only a small irregularity. Several of
the girls, the majority, indeed, had brothers or cousins at the
neighbouring college. But "la robe grise, le chapeau de paille,"
here surely was a clue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a very confusing one. The
straw-hat was an ordinary garden head-screen, common to a score
besides myself. The grey dress hardly gave more definite
indication. Madame Beck herself ordinarily wore a grey dress just
now; another teacher, and three of the pensionnaires, had had grey
dresses purchased of the same shade and fabric as mine: it was a
sort of every-day wear which happened at that time to be in
vogue.</p>
<p id="id00810">Meanwhile, as I pondered, I knew I must go in.
Lights, moving in the dormitory, announced that prayers were over,
and the pupils going to bed. Another half-hour and all doors would
be locked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all lights extinguished. The front
door yet stood open, to admit into the heated house the coolness of
the summer night; from the portress's cabinet close by shone a
lamp, showing the long vestibule with the two-leaved drawing-room
doors on one side, the great street-door closing the vista.</p>
<p id="id00811">All at once, quick rang the
bell&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quick, but not loud&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
cautious tinkle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sort of warning metal whisper.
Rosine darted from her cabinet and ran to open. The person she
admitted stood with her two minutes in parley: there seemed a
demur, a delay. Rosine came to the garden door, lamp in hand; she
stood on the steps, lifting her lamp, looking round vaguely.</p>
<p id="id00812">"Quel conte!" she cried, with a coquettish laugh.
"Personne n'y a &Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy;."</p>
<p id="id00813">"Let me pass," pleaded a voice I knew: "I ask but
five minutes;" and a familiar shape, tall and grand (as we of the
Rue Fossette all thought it), issued from the house, and strode
down amongst the beds and walks. It was
sacrilege&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the intrusion of a man into that spot,
at that hour; but he knew himself privileged, and perhaps he
trusted to the friendly night. He wandered down the alleys, looking
on this side and on that&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was lost in the
shrubs, trampling flowers and breaking branches in his
search&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he penetrated at last the "forbidden
walk." There I met him, like some ghost, I suppose.</p>
<p id="id00814">"Dr. John! it is found."</p>
<p id="id00815">He did not ask by whom, for with his quick eye he
perceived that I held it in my hand.</p>
<p id="id00816">"Do not betray her," he said, looking at me as if I
were indeed a dragon.</p>
<p id="id00817">"Were I ever so disposed to treachery, I cannot
betray what I do not know," was my answer. "Read the note, and you
will see how little it reveals."</p>
<p id="id00818">"Perhaps you have read it," I thought to myself;
and yet I could not believe he wrote it: that could hardly be his
style: besides, I was fool enough to think there would be a degree
of hardship in his calling me such names. His own look vindicated
him; he grew hot, and coloured as he read.</p>
<p id="id00819">"This is indeed too much: this is cruel, this is
humiliating," were the words that fell from him.</p>
<p id="id00820">I thought it <i>was</i> cruel, when I saw his
countenance so moved. No matter whether he was to blame or not;
somebody, it seemed to me, must be more to blame.</p>
<p id="id00821">"What shall you do about it?" he inquired of me.
"Shall you tell Madame<br />
Beck what you have found, and cause a stir&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an
esclandre?"<br /></p>
<p id="id00822">I thought I ought to tell, and said so; adding that
I did not believe there would be either stir or esclandre: Madame
was much too prudent to make a noise about an affair of that sort
connected with her establishment.</p>
<p id="id00823">He stood looking down and meditating. He was both
too proud and too honourable to entreat my secresy on a point which
duty evidently commanded me to communicate. I wished to do right,
yet loathed to grieve or injure him. Just then Rosine glanced out
through the open door; she could not see us, though between the
trees I could plainly see her: her dress was grey, like mine. This
circumstance, taken in connection with prior transactions,
suggested to me that perhaps the case, however deplorable, was one
in which I was under no obligation whatever to concern myself.
Accordingly, I said,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"If you can assure me that
none of Madame Beck's pupils are implicated in this business, I
shall be very happy to stand aloof from all interference. Take the
casket, the bouquet, and the billet; for my part, I gladly forget
the whole affair."</p>
<p id="id00824">"Look there!" he whispered suddenly, as his hand
closed on what I offered, and at the same time he pointed through
the boughs.</p>
<p id="id00825">I looked. Behold Madame, in shawl, wrapping-gown,
and slippers, softly descending the steps, and stealing like a cat
round the garden: in two minutes she would have been upon Dr. John.
If <i>she</i> were like a cat, however, <i>he</i>, quite as much,
resembled a leopard: nothing could be lighter than his tread when
he chose. He watched, and as she turned a corner, he took the
garden at two noiseless bounds. She reappeared, and he was gone.
Rosine helped him, instantly interposing the door between him and
his huntress. I, too, might have got, away, but I preferred to meet
Madame openly.</p>
<p id="id00826">Though it was my frequent and well-known custom to
spend twilight in the garden, yet, never till now, had I remained
so late. Full sure was I that Madame had
missed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was come in search of me, and designed
now to pounce on the defaulter unawares. I expected a reprimand.
No. Madame was all goodness. She tendered not even a remonstrance;
she testified no shade of surprise. With that consummate tact of
hers, in which I believe she was never surpassed by living thing,
she even professed merely to have issued forth to taste "la brise
du soir."</p>
<p id="id00827">"Quelle belle nuit!" cried she, looking up at the
stars&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the moon was now gone down behind the
broad tower of Jean Baptiste. "Qu'il fait bon? que l'air est
frais!"</p>
<p id="id00828">And, instead of sending me in, she detained me to
take a few turns with her down the principal alley. When at last we
both re-entered, she leaned affably on my shoulder by way of
support in mounting the front-door steps; at parting, her cheek was
presented to my lips, and "Bon soir, my bonne amie; dormez bien!"
was her kindly adieu for the night.</p>
<p id="id00829">I caught myself smiling as I lay awake and
thoughtful on my couch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;smiling at Madame. The
unction, the suavity of her behaviour offered, for one who knew
her, a sure token that suspicion of some kind was busy in her
brain. From some aperture or summit of observation, through parted
bough or open window, she had doubtless caught a glimpse, remote or
near, deceptive or instructive, of that night's transactions.
Finely accomplished as she was in the art of surveillance, it was
next to impossible that a casket could be thrown into her garden,
or an interloper could cross her walks to seek it, without that
she, in shaken branch, passing shade, unwonted footfall, or stilly
murmur (and though Dr. John had spoken very low in the few words he
dropped me, yet the hum of his man's voice pervaded, I thought, the
whole conventual ground)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;without, I say, that
she should have caught intimation of things extraordinary
transpiring on her premises. <i>What</i> things, she might by no
means see, or at that time be able to discover; but a delicious
little ravelled plot lay tempting her to disentanglement; and in
the midst, folded round and round in cobwebs, had she not secured
"Meess Lucie" clumsily involved, like the foolish fly she was?</p>
<h2 id="id00830" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h5 id="id00831">A SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON.</h5>
<p id="id00832" style="margin-top: 2em">I had occasion to
smile&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nay, to laugh, at Madame again, within the
space of four and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in
the last chapter.</p>
<p id="id00833">Villette owns a climate as variable, though not so
humid, as that of any English town. A night of high wind followed
upon that soft sunset, and all the next day was one of dry
storm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dark, beclouded, yet
rainless,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the streets were dim with sand and
dust, whirled from the boulevards. I know not that even lovely
weather would have tempted me to spend the evening-time of study
and recreation where I had spent it yesterday. My alley, and,
indeed, all the walks and shrubs in the garden, had acquired a new,
but not a pleasant interest; their seclusion was now become
precarious; their calm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;insecure. That casement
which rained billets, had vulgarized the once dear nook it
overlooked; and elsewhere, the eyes of the flowers had gained
vision, and the knots in the tree-boles listened like secret ears.
Some plants there were, indeed, trodden down by Dr. John in his
search, and his hasty and heedless progress, which I wished to prop
up, water, and revive; some footmarks, too, he had left on the
beds: but these, in spite of the strong wind, I found a moment's
leisure to efface very early in the morning, ere common eyes had
discovered them. With a pensive sort of content, I sat down to my
desk and my German, while the pupils settled to their evening
lessons; and the other teachers took up their needlework.</p>
<p id="id00834">The scene of the "etude du soir" was always the
refectory, a much smaller apartment than any of the three classes
or schoolrooms; for here none, save the boarders, were ever
admitted, and these numbered only a score. Two lamps hung from the
ceiling over the two tables; these were lit at dusk, and their
kindling was the signal for school-books being set aside, a grave
demeanour assumed, general silence enforced, and then commenced "la
lecture pieuse." This said "lecture pieuse" was, I soon found,
mainly designed as a wholesome mortification of the Intellect, a
useful humiliation of the Reason; and such a dose for Common Sense
as she might digest at her leisure, and thrive on as she best
could.</p>
<p id="id00835">The book brought out (it was never changed, but
when finished, recommenced) was a venerable volume, old as the
hills&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;grey as the H&Atilde;&acute;tel de
Ville.</p>
<p id="id00836">I would have given two francs for the chance of
getting that book once into my bands, turning over the sacred
yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and perusing with my own
eyes the enormous figments which, as an unworthy heretic, it was
only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears. This book
contained legends of the saints. Good God! (I speak the words
reverently) what legends they were. What gasconading rascals those
saints must have been, if they first boasted these exploits or
invented these miracles. These legends, however, were no more than
monkish extravagances, over which one laughed inwardly; there were,
besides, priestly matters, and the priestcraft of the book was far
worse than its monkery. The ears burned on each side of my head as
I listened, perforce, to tales of moral martyrdom inflicted by
Rome; the dread boasts of confessors, who had wickedly abused their
office, trampling to deep degradation high-born ladies, making of
countesses and princesses the most tormented slaves under the sun.
Stories like that of Conrad and Elizabeth of Hungary, recurred
again and again, with all its dreadful viciousness, sickening
tyranny and black impiety: tales that were nightmares of
oppression, privation, and agony.</p>
<p id="id00837">I sat out this "lecture pieuse" for some nights as
well as I could, and as quietly too; only once breaking off the
points of my scissors by involuntarily sticking them somewhat deep
in the worm-eaten board of the table before me. But, at last, it
made me so burning hot, and my temples, and my heart, and my wrist
throbbed so fast, and my sleep afterwards was so broken with
excitement, that I could sit no longer. Prudence recommended
henceforward a swift clearance of my person from the place, the
moment that guilty old book was brought out. No Mause Headrigg ever
felt a stronger call to take up her testimony against Sergeant
Bothwell, than I&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to speak my mind in this matter
of the popish "lecture pieuse." However, I did manage somehow to
curb and rein in; and though always, as soon as Rosine came to
light the lamps, I shot from the room quickly, yet also I did it
quietly; seizing that vantage moment given by the little bustle
before the dead silence, and vanishing whilst the boarders put
their books away.</p>
<p id="id00838">When I vanished&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it was into
darkness; candles were not allowed to be carried about, and the
teacher who forsook the refectory, had only the unlit hall,
schoolroom, or bedroom, as a refuge. In winter I sought the long
classes, and paced them fast to keep myself
warm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fortunate if the moon shone, and if there
were only stars, soon reconciled to their dim gleam, or even to the
total eclipse of their absence. In summer it was never quite dark,
and then I went up-stairs to my own quarter of the long dormitory,
opened my own casement (that chamber was lit by five casements
large as great doors), and leaning out, looked forth upon the city
beyond the garden, and listened to band-music from the park or the
palace-square, thinking meantime my own thoughts, living my own
life, in my own still, shadow-world.</p>
<p id="id00839">This evening, fugitive as usual before the Pope and
his works, I mounted the staircase, approached the dormitory, and
quietly opened the door, which was always kept carefully shut, and
which, like every other door in this house, revolved noiselessly on
well-oiled hinges. Before I <i>saw</i>, I <i>felt</i> that life was
in the great room, usually void: not that there was either stir or
breath, or rustle of sound, but Vacuum lacked, Solitude was not at
home. All the white beds&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the "lits d'ange," as
they were poetically termed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;lay visible at a
glance; all were empty: no sleeper reposed therein. The sound of a
drawer cautiously slid out struck my ear; stepping a little to one
side, my vision took a free range, unimpeded by falling curtains. I
now commanded my own bed and my own toilet, with a locked work-box
upon it, and locked drawers underneath.</p>
<p id="id00840">Very good. A dumpy, motherly little body, in decent
shawl and the cleanest of possible nightcaps, stood before this
toilet, hard at work apparently doing me the kindness of "tidying
out" the "meuble." Open stood the lid of the work-box, open the top
drawer; duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in
turn: not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded,
not a paper but was glanced over, not a little box but was
unlidded; and beautiful was the adroitness, exemplary the care with
which the search was accomplished. Madame wrought at it like a true
star, "unhasting yet unresting." I will not deny that it was with a
secret glee I watched her. Had I been a gentleman I believe Madame
would have found favour in my eyes, she was so handy, neat,
thorough in all she did: some people's movements provoke the soul
by their loose awkwardness, hers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;satisfied by
their trim compactness. I stood, in short, fascinated; but it was
necessary to make an effort to break this spell a retreat must be
beaten. The searcher might have turned and caught me; there would
have been nothing for it then but a scene, and she and I would have
had to come all at once, with a sudden clash, to a thorough
knowledge of each other: down would have gone conventionalities,
away swept disguises, and <i>I</i> should have looked into her
eyes, and she into mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;we should have known
that we could work together no more, and parted in this life for
ever.</p>
<p id="id00841">Where was the use of tempting such a catastrophe? I
was not angry, and had no wish in the world to leave her. I could
hardly get another employer whose yoke would be so light and so,
easy of carriage; and truly I liked Madame for her capital sense,
whatever I might think of her principles: as to her system, it did
me no harm; she might work me with it to her heart's content:
nothing would come of the operation. Loverless and inexpectant of
love, I was as safe from spies in my heart-poverty, as the beggar
from thieves in his destitution of purse. I turned, then, and fled;
descending the stairs with progress as swift and soundless as that
of the spider, which at the same instant ran down the
bannister.</p>
<p id="id00842">How I laughed when I reached the schoolroom. I knew
now she had certainly seen Dr. John in the garden; I knew what her
thoughts were. The spectacle of a suspicious nature so far misled
by its own inventions, tickled me much. Yet as the laugh died, a
kind of wrath smote me, and then bitterness followed: it was the
rock struck, and Meribah's waters gushing out. I never had felt so
strange and contradictory an inward tumult as I felt for an hour
that evening: soreness and laughter, and fire, and grief, shared my
heart between them. I cried hot tears: not because Madame
mistrusted me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I did not care twopence for her
mistrust&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but for other reasons. Complicated,
disquieting thoughts broke up the whole repose of my nature.
However, that turmoil subsided: next day I was again Lucy
Snowe.</p>
<p id="id00843">On revisiting my drawers, I found them all securely
locked; the closest subsequent examination could not discover
change or apparent disturbance in the position of one object. My
few dresses were folded as I had left them; a certain little bunch
of white violets that had once been silently presented to me by a
stranger (a stranger to me, for we had never exchanged words), and
which I had dried and kept for its sweet perfume between the folds
of my best dress, lay there unstirred; my black silk scarf, my lace
chemisette and collars, were unrumpled. Had she creased one
solitary article, I own I should have felt much greater difficulty
in forgiving her; but finding all straight and orderly, I said,
"Let bygones be bygones. I am unharmed: why should I bear
malice?"</p>
<p id="id00844">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id00845">A thing there was which puzzled myself, and I
sought in my brain a key to that riddle almost as sedulously as
Madame had sought a guide to useful knowledge in my toilet drawers.
How was it that Dr. John, if he had not been accessory to the
dropping of that casket into the garden, should have known that it
<i>was</i> dropped, and appeared so promptly on the spot to seek
it? So strong was the wish to clear up this point that I began to
entertain this daring suggestion: "Why may I not, in case I should
ever have the opportunity, ask Dr. John himself to explain this
coincidence?"</p>
<p id="id00846">And so long as Dr. John was absent, I really
believed I had courage to test him with such a question.</p>
<p id="id00847">Little Georgette was now convalescent; and her
physician accordingly made his visits very rare: indeed, he would
have ceased them altogether, had not Madame insisted on his giving
an occasional call till the child should be quite well.</p>
<p id="id00848">She came into the nursery one evening just after I
had listened to Georgette's lisped and broken prayer, and had put
her to bed. Taking the little one's hand, she said, "Cette enfant a
toujours un peu de fi&Atilde;&uml;vre." And presently afterwards,
looking at me with a quicker glance than was habitual to her quiet
eye, "Le Docteur John l'a-t-il vue derni&Atilde;&uml;rement? Non,
n'est-ce pas?"</p>
<p id="id00849">Of course she knew this better than any other
person in the house. "Well," she continued, "I am going out, pour
faire quelques courses en fiacre. I shall call on Dr. John, and
send him to the child. I will that he sees her this evening; her
cheeks are flushed, her pulse is quick; <i>you</i> will receive
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for my part, I shall be from home."</p>
<p id="id00850">Now the child was well enough, only warm with the
warmth of July; it was scarcely less needful to send for a priest
to administer extreme unction than for a doctor to prescribe a
dose; also Madame rarely made "courses," as she called them, in the
evening: moreover, this was the first time she had chosen to absent
herself on the occasion of a visit from Dr. John. The whole
arrangement indicated some plan; this I saw, but without the least
anxiety. "Ha! ha! Madame," laughed Light-heart the Beggar, "your
crafty wits are on the wrong tack."</p>
<p id="id00851">She departed, attired very smartly, in a shawl of
price, and a certain <i>chapeau vert
tendre</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hazardous, as to its tint, for any
complexion less fresh than her own, but, to her, not unbecoming. I
wondered what she intended: whether she really would send Dr. John
or not; or whether indeed he would come: he might be engaged.</p>
<p id="id00852">Madame had charged me not to let Georgette sleep
till the doctor came; I had therefore sufficient occupation in
telling her nursery tales and palavering the little language for
her benefit. I affected Georgette; she was a sensitive and a loving
child: to hold her in my lap, or carry her in my arms, was to me a
treat. To-night she would have me lay my head on the pillow of her
crib; she even put her little arms round my neck. Her clasp, and
the nestling action with which she pressed her cheek to mine, made
me almost cry with a tender pain. Feeling of no kind abounded in
that house; this pure little drop from a pure little source was too
sweet: it penetrated deep, and subdued the heart, and sent a gush
to the eyes. Half an hour or an hour passed; Georgette murmured in
her soft lisp that she was growing sleepy. "And you <i>shall</i>
sleep," thought I, "malgr&Atilde;&copy; maman and
m&Atilde;&copy;decin, if they are not here in ten minutes."</p>
<p id="id00853">Hark! There was the ring, and there the tread,
astonishing the staircase by the fleetness with which it left the
steps behind. Rosine introduced Dr. John, and, with a freedom of
manner not altogether peculiar to herself, but characteristic of
the domestics of Villette generally, she stayed to hear what he had
to say. Madame's presence would have awed her back to her own realm
of the vestibule and the cabinet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for mine, or
that of any other teacher or pupil, she cared not a jot. Smart,
trim and pert, she stood, a hand in each pocket of her gay grisette
apron, eyeing Dr. John with no more fear or shyness than if he had
been a picture instead of a living gentleman.</p>
<p id="id00854">"Le marmot n'a rien, nest-ce pas?" said she,
indicating Georgette with a jerk of her chin.</p>
<p id="id00855">"Pas beaucoup," was the answer, as the doctor
hastily scribbled with his pencil some harmless prescription.</p>
<p id="id00856">"Eh bien!" pursued Rosine, approaching him quite
near, while he put up his pencil. "And the
box&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;did you get it? Monsieur went off like a
coup-de-vent the other night; I had not time to ask him."</p>
<p id="id00857">"I found it: yes."</p>
<p id="id00858">"And who threw it, then?" continued Rosine,
speaking quite freely the very words I should so much have wished
to say, but had no address or courage to bring it out: how short
some people make the road to a point which, for others, seems
unattainable!</p>
<p id="id00859">"That may be my secret," rejoined Dr. John briefly,
but with no, sort of hauteur: he seemed quite to understand the
Rosine or grisette character.</p>
<p id="id00860">"Mais enfin," continued she, nothing abashed,
"monsieur knew it was thrown, since he came to seek
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how did he know?"</p>
<p id="id00861">"I was attending a little patient in the college
near," said he, "and saw it dropped out of his chamber window, and
so came to pick it up."</p>
<p id="id00862">How simple the whole explanation! The note had
alluded to a physician as then examining "Gustave."</p>
<p id="id00863">"Ah &Atilde;&sect;a!" pursued Rosine; "il n'y a
donc rien l&Atilde;&nbsp;-dessous: pas de myst&Atilde;&uml;re, pas
d'amourette, par exemple?"</p>
<p id="id00864">"Pas plus que sur ma main," responded the doctor,
showing his palm.</p>
<p id="id00865">"Quel dommage!" responded the grisette: "et
moi&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&Atilde;&nbsp; qui tout cela
commen&Atilde;&sect;ait &Atilde;&nbsp; donner des
id&Atilde;&copy;es."</p>
<p id="id00866">"Vraiment! vous en &Atilde;&ordf;tes pour vos
frais," was the doctor's cool rejoinder.</p>
<p id="id00867">She pouted. The doctor could not help laughing at
the sort of "moue" she made: when he laughed, he had something
peculiarly good-natured and genial in his look. I saw his hand
incline to his pocket.</p>
<p id="id00868">"How many times have you opened the door for me
within this last month?" he asked.</p>
<p id="id00869">"Monsieur ought to have kept count of that," said
Rosine, quite readily.</p>
<p id="id00870">"As if I had not something better to do!" rejoined
he; but I saw him give her a piece of gold, which she took
unscrupulously, and then danced off to answer the door-bell,
ringing just now every five minutes, as the various servants came
to fetch the half-boarders.</p>
<p id="id00871">The reader must not think too hardly of Rosine; on
the whole, she was not a bad sort of person, and had no idea there
could be any disgrace in grasping at whatever she could get, or any
effrontery in chattering like a pie to the best gentleman in
Christendom.</p>
<p id="id00872">I had learnt something from the above scene besides
what concerned the ivory box: viz., that not on the robe de
jaconas, pink or grey, nor yet on the frilled and pocketed apron,
lay the blame of breaking Dr. John's heart: these items of array
were obviously guiltless as Georgette's little blue tunic. So much
the better. But who then was the culprit? What was the
ground&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what the origin&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what
the perfect explanation of the whole business? Some points had been
cleared, but how many yet remained obscure as night!</p>
<p id="id00873">"However," I said to myself, "it is no affair of
yours;" and turning from the face on which I had been unconsciously
dwelling with a questioning gaze, I looked through the window which
commanded the garden below. Dr. John, meantime, standing by the
bed-side, was slowly drawing on his gloves and watching his little
patient, as her eyes closed and her rosy lips parted in coming
sleep. I waited till he should depart as usual, with a quick bow
and scarce articulate "good-night.". Just as he took his hat, my
eyes, fixed on the tall houses bounding the garden, saw the one
lattice, already commemorated, cautiously open; forth from the
aperture projected a hand and a white handkerchief; both waved. I
know not whether the signal was answered from some viewless quarter
of our own dwelling; but immediately after there fluttered from,
the lattice a falling object, white and
light&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;billet the second, of course.</p>
<p id="id00874">"There!" I ejaculated involuntarily.</p>
<p id="id00875">"Where?", asked Dr. John with energy, making direct
for the window.<br />
"What, is it?"<br /></p>
<p id="id00876">"They have gone and done it again," was my reply.
"A handkerchief waved and something fell:" and I pointed to the
lattice, now closed and looking hypocritically blank.</p>
<p id="id00877">"Go, at once; pick it up and bring it here," was
his prompt direction; adding, "Nobody will take notice of <i>you:
I</i> should be seen."</p>
<p id="id00878">Straight I went. After some little search, I found
a folded paper, lodged on the lower branch of a shrub; I seized and
brought it direct to Dr. John. This time, I believe not even Rosine
saw me.</p>
<p id="id00879">He instantly tore the billet into small pieces,
without reading it. "It is not in the least <i>her</i> fault, you
must remember," he said, looking at me.</p>
<p id="id00880">"<i>Whose</i> fault?" I asked. "<i>Who</i> is
it?"</p>
<p id="id00881">"You don't yet know, then?"</p>
<p id="id00882">"Not in the least."</p>
<p id="id00883">"Have you no guess?"</p>
<p id="id00884">"None."</p>
<p id="id00885">"If I knew you better, I might be tempted to risk
some confidence, and thus secure you as guardian over a most
innocent and excellent, but somewhat inexperienced being."</p>
<p id="id00886">"As a duenna?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id00887">"Yes," said he abstractedly. "What snares are round
her!" he added, musingly: and now, certainly for the first time, he
examined my face, anxious, doubtless, to see if any kindly
expression there, would warrant him in recommending to my care and
indulgence some ethereal creature, against whom powers of darkness
were plotting. I felt no particular vocation to undertake the
surveillance of ethereal creatures; but recalling the scene at the
bureau, it seemed to me that I owed <i>him</i> a good turn: if I
<i>could</i> help him then I would, and it lay not with me to
decide how. With as little reluctance as might be, I intimated that
"I was willing to do what I could towards taking care of any person
in whom he might be interested.".</p>
<p id="id00888">"I am no farther interested than as a spectator,"
said he, with a modesty, admirable, as I thought, to witness. "I
happen to be acquainted with the rather worthless character of the
person, who, from the house opposite, has now twice invaded the
sanctity of this place; I have also met in society the object at
whom these vulgar attempts are aimed. Her exquisite superiority and
innate refinement ought, one would think, to scare impertinence
from her very idea. It is not so, however; and innocent,
unsuspicious as she is, I would guard her from evil if I could. In
person, however, I can do nothing I cannot come near
her"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he paused.</p>
<p id="id00889">"Well, I am willing to help you," said I, "only
tell me how." And busily, in my own mind, I ran over the list of
our inmates, seeking this paragon, this pearl of great price, this
gem without flaw. "It must be Madame," I concluded. "<i>She</i>
only, amongst us all, has the art even to <i>seem</i> superior: but
as to being unsuspicious, inexperienced, &amp;c., Dr. John need not
distract himself about that. However, this is just his whim, and I
will not contradict him; he shall be humoured: his angel shall be
an angel.</p>
<p id="id00890">"Just notify the quarter to which my care is to be
directed," I continued gravely: chuckling, however, to myself over
the thought of being set to chaperon Madame Beck or any of her
pupils. Now Dr. John had a fine set of nerves, and he at once felt
by instinct, what no more coarsely constituted mind would have
detected; namely, that I was a little amused at him. The colour
rose to his cheek; with half a smile he turned and took his
hat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was going. My heart smote me.</p>
<p id="id00891">"I will&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I will help you," said I
eagerly. "I will do what you wish. I will watch over your angel; I
will take care of her, only tell me who she is."</p>
<p id="id00892">"But you <i>must</i> know," said he then with
earnestness, yet speaking very low. "So spotless, so good, so
unspeakably beautiful! impossible that one house should contain two
like her. I allude, of course&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id00893">Here the latch of Madame Beck's chamber-door
(opening into the nursery) gave a sudden click, as if the hand
holding it had been slightly convulsed; there was the suppressed
explosion of an irrepressible sneeze. These little accidents will
happen to the best of us. Madame&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;excellent
woman! was then on duty. She had come home quietly, stolen
up-stairs on tip-toe; she was in her chamber. If she had not
sneezed, she would have heard all, and so should I; but that
unlucky sternutation routed Dr. John. While he stood aghast, she
came forward alert, composed, in the best yet most tranquil
spirits: no novice to her habits but would have thought she had
just come in, and scouted the idea of her ear having been glued to
the key-hole for at least ten minutes. She affected to sneeze
again, declared she was "enrhum&Atilde;&copy;e," and then proceeded
volubly to recount her "courses en fiacre." The prayer-bell rang,
and I left her with the doctor.</p>
<h2 id="id00894" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h5 id="id00895">THE F&Atilde;&Scaron;TE.</h5>
<p id="id00896" style="margin-top: 2em">As soon as Georgette was
well, Madame sent her away into the country. I was sorry; I loved
the child, and her loss made me poorer than before. But I must not
complain. I lived in a house full of robust life; I might have had
companions, and I chose solitude. Each of the teachers in turn made
me overtures of special intimacy; I tried them all. One I found to
be an honest woman, but a narrow thinker, a coarse feeler, and an
egotist. The second was a Parisienne, externally
refined&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at heart,
corrupt&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;without a creed, without a principle,
without an affection: having penetrated the outward crust of
decorum in this character, you found a slough beneath. She had a
wonderful passion for presents; and, in this point, the third
teacher&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a person otherwise characterless and
insignificant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;closely resembled her. This
last-named had also one other distinctive
property&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that of avarice. In her reigned the
love of money for its own sake. The sight of a piece of gold would
bring into her eyes a green glisten, singular to witness. She once,
as a mark of high favour, took me up-stairs, and, opening a secret
door, showed me a hoard&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a mass of coarse, large
coin&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;about fifteen guineas, in five-franc
pieces. She loved this hoard as a bird loves its eggs. These were
her savings. She would come and talk to me about them with an
infatuated and persevering dotage, strange to behold in a person
not yet twenty-five.</p>
<p id="id00897">The Parisienne, on the other hand, was prodigal and
profligate (in disposition, that is: as to action, I do not know).
That latter quality showed its snake-head to me but once, peeping
out very cautiously. A curious kind of reptile it seemed, judging
from the glimpse I got; its novelty whetted my curiosity: if it
would have come out boldly, perhaps I might philosophically have
stood my ground, and coolly surveyed the long thing from forked
tongue to scaly tail-tip; but it merely rustled in the leaves of a
bad novel; and, on encountering a hasty and ill-advised
demonstration of wrath, recoiled and vanished, hissing. She hated
me from that day.</p>
<p id="id00898">This Parisienne was always in debt; her salary
being anticipated, not only in dress, but in perfumes, cosmetics,
confectionery, and condiments. What a cold, callous epicure she was
in all things! I see her now. Thin in face and figure, sallow in
complexion, regular in features, with perfect teeth, lips like a
thread, a large, prominent chin, a well-opened, but frozen eye, of
light at once craving and ingrate. She mortally hated work, and
loved what she called pleasure; being an insipid, heartless,
brainless dissipation of time.</p>
<p id="id00899">Madame Beck knew this woman's character perfectly
well. She once talked to me about her, with an odd mixture of
discrimination, indifference, and antipathy. I asked why she kept
her in the establishment. She answered plainly, "because it suited
her interest to do so;" and pointed out a fact I had already
noticed, namely, that Mademoiselle St. Pierre possessed, in an
almost unique degree, the power of keeping order amongst her
undisciplined ranks of scholars. A certain petrifying influence
accompanied and surrounded her: without passion, noise, or
violence, she held them in check as a breezeless frost-air might
still a brawling stream. She was of little use as far as
communication of knowledge went, but for strict surveillance and
maintenance of rules she was invaluable. "Je sais bien qu'elle n'a
pas de principes, ni, peut-&Atilde;&ordf;tre, de moeurs," admitted
Madame frankly; but added with philosophy, "son maintien en classe
est toujours convenable et rempli m&Atilde;&ordf;me d'une certaine
dignit&Atilde;&copy;: c'est tout ce qu'il faut. Ni les
&Atilde;&copy;l&Atilde;&uml;ves ni les parents ne regardent plus
loin; ni, par cons&Atilde;&copy;quent, moi non plus."</p>
<p id="id00900">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id00901">A strange, frolicsome, noisy little world was this
school: great pains were taken to hide chains with flowers: a
subtle essence of Romanism pervaded every arrangement: large
sensual indulgence (so to speak) was permitted by way of
counterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint. Each mind was being
reared in slavery; but, to prevent reflection from dwelling on this
fact, every pretext for physical recreation was seized and made the
most of. There, as elsewhere, the CHURCH strove to bring up her
children robust in body, feeble in soul, fat, ruddy, hale, joyous,
ignorant, unthinking, unquestioning. "Eat, drink, and live!" she
says. "Look after your bodies; leave your souls to me. I hold their
cure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;guide their course: I guarantee their final
fate." A bargain, in which every true Catholic deems himself a
gainer. Lucifer just offers the same terms: "All this power will I
give thee, and the glory of it; for that is delivered unto me, and
to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship
me, all shall be thine!"</p>
<p id="id00902">About this time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in the ripest
glow of summer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Madame Beck's house became as
merry a place as a school could well be. All day long the broad
folding-doors and the two-leaved casements stood wide open: settled
sunshine seemed naturalized in the atmosphere; clouds were far off,
sailing away beyond sea, resting, no doubt, round islands such as
England&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that dear land of
mists&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but withdrawn wholly from the drier
continent. We lived far more in the garden than under a roof:
classes were held, and meals partaken of, in the "grand berceau."
Moreover, there was a note of holiday preparation, which almost
turned freedom into licence. The autumnal long vacation was but two
months distant; but before that, a great day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an
important ceremony&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;none other than the
f&Atilde;&ordf;te of Madame&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;awaited
celebration.</p>
<p id="id00903">The conduct of this f&Atilde;&ordf;te devolved
chiefly on Mademoiselle St. Pierre: Madame herself being supposed
to stand aloof, disinterestedly unconscious of what might be going
forward in her honour. Especially, she never knew, never in the
least suspected, that a subscription was annually levied on the
whole school for the purchase of a handsome present. The polite
tact of the reader will please to leave out of the account a brief,
secret consultation on this point in Madame's own chamber.</p>
<p id="id00904">"What will you have this year?" was asked by her
Parisian lieutenant.</p>
<p id="id00905">"Oh, no matter! Let it alone. Let the poor children
keep their francs,"<br />
And Madame looked benign and modest.<br /></p>
<p id="id00906">The St. Pierre would here protrude her chin; she
knew Madame by heart; she always called her airs of
"bont&Atilde;&copy;"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"des grimaces." She never
even professed to respect them one instant.</p>
<p id="id00907">"Vite!" she would say coldly. "Name the article.
Shall it be jewellery or porcelain, haberdashery or silver?"</p>
<p id="id00908">"Eh bien! Deux ou trois cuillers, et autant de
fourchettes en argent."</p>
<p id="id00909">And the result was a handsome case, containing 300
francs worth of plate.</p>
<p id="id00910">The programme of the f&Atilde;&ordf;te-day's
proceedings comprised: Presentation of plate, collation in the
garden, dramatic performance (with pupils and teachers for actors),
a dance and supper. Very gorgeous seemed the effect of the whole to
me, as I well remember. Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St. Pierre understood
these things and managed them ably.</p>
<p id="id00911">The play was the main point; a month's previous
drilling being there required. The choice, too, of the actors
required knowledge and care; then came lessons in elocution, in
attitude, and then the fatigue of countless rehearsals. For all
this, as may well be supposed, St. Pierre did not suffice: other
management, other accomplishments than hers were requisite here.
They were supplied in the person of a master&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;M.
Paul Emanuel, professor of literature. It was never my lot to be
present at the histrionic lessons of M. Paul, but I often saw him
as he crossed the <i>carr&Atilde;&copy;</i> (a square hall between
the dwelling-house and school-house). I heard him, too, in the warm
evenings, lecturing with open doors, and his name, with anecdotes
of him, resounded in ones ears from all sides. Especially our
former acquaintance, Miss Ginevra Fanshawe,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who
had been selected to take a prominent part in the
play&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;used, in bestowing upon me a large portion
of her leisure, to lard her discourse with frequent allusions to
his sayings and doings. She esteemed him hideously plain, and used
to profess herself frightened almost into hysterics at the sound of
his step or voice. A dark little man he certainly was; pungent and
austere. Even to me he seemed a harsh apparition, with his
close-shorn, black head, his broad, sallow brow, his thin cheek,
his wide and quivering nostril, his thorough glance, and hurried
bearing. Irritable he was; one heard that, as he apostrophized with
vehemence the awkward squad under his orders. Sometimes he would
break out on these raw amateur actresses with a passion of
impatience at their falseness of conception, their coldness of
emotion, their feebleness of delivery. "Ecoutez!" he would cry; and
then his voice rang through the premises like a trumpet; and when,
mimicking it, came the small pipe of a Ginevra, a Mathilde, or a
Blanche, one understood why a hollow groan of scorn, or a fierce
hiss of rage, rewarded the tame echo.</p>
<p id="id00912">"Vous n'&Atilde;&ordf;tes donc que des
poup&Atilde;&copy;es," I heard him thunder. "Vous n'avez pas de
passions&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;vous autres. Vous ne sentez donc rien?
Votre chair est de neige, votre sang de glace! Moi, je veux que
tout cela s'allume, qu'il ait une vie, une &Atilde;&cent;me!"</p>
<p id="id00913">Vain resolve! And when he at last found it
<i>was</i> vain, he suddenly broke the whole business down.
Hitherto he had been teaching them a grand tragedy; he tore the
tragedy in morsels, and came next day with a compact little comic
trifle. To this they took more kindly; he presently knocked it all
into their smooth round pates.</p>
<p id="id00914">Mademoiselle St. Pierre always presided at M.
Emanuel's lessons, and I was told that the polish of her manner,
her seeming attention, her tact and grace, impressed that gentleman
very favourably. She had, indeed, the art of pleasing, for a given
time, whom she would; but the feeling would not last: in an hour it
was dried like dew, vanished like gossamer.</p>
<p id="id00915">The day preceding Madame's f&Atilde;&ordf;te was as
much a holiday as the f&Atilde;&ordf;te itself. It was devoted to
clearing out, cleaning, arranging and decorating the three
schoolrooms. All within-doors was the gayest bustle; neither
up-stairs nor down could a quiet, isolated person find rest for the
sole of her foot; accordingly, for my part, I took refuge in the
garden. The whole day did I wander or sit there alone, finding
warmth in the sun, shelter among the trees, and a sort of
companionship in my own thoughts. I well remember that I exchanged
but two sentences that day with any living being: not that I felt
solitary; I was glad to be quiet. For a looker-on, it sufficed to
pass through the rooms once or twice, observe what changes were
being wrought, how a green-room and a dressing-room were being
contrived, a little stage with scenery erected, how M. Paul
Emanuel, in conjunction with Mademoiselle St. Pierre, was directing
all, and how an eager band of pupils, amongst them Ginevra
Fanshawe, were working gaily under his control.</p>
<p id="id00916">The great day arrived. The sun rose hot and
unclouded, and hot and unclouded it burned on till evening. All the
doors and all the windows were set open, which gave a pleasant
sense of summer freedom&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and freedom the most
complete seemed indeed the order of the day. Teachers and pupils
descended to breakfast in dressing-gowns and curl-papers:
anticipating "avec d&Atilde;&copy;lices" the toilette of the
evening, they seemed to take a pleasure in indulging that forenoon
in a luxury of slovenliness; like aldermen fasting in preparation
for a feast. About nine o'clock A.M., an important functionary, the
"coiffeur," arrived. Sacrilegious to state, he fixed his
head-quarters in the oratory, and there, in presence of
<i>b&Atilde;&copy;nitier</i>, candle, and crucifix, solemnised the
mysteries of his art. Each girl was summoned in turn to pass
through his hands; emerging from them with head as smooth as a
shell, intersected by faultless white lines, and wreathed about
with Grecian plaits that shone as if lacquered. I took my turn with
the rest, and could hardly believe what the glass said when I
applied to it for information afterwards; the lavished garlandry of
woven brown hair amazed me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I feared it was not
all my own, and it required several convincing pulls to give
assurance to the contrary. I then acknowledged in the coiffeur a
first-rate artist&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one who certainly made the
most of indifferent materials.</p>
<p id="id00917">The oratory closed, the dormitory became the scene
of ablutions, arrayings and bedizenings curiously elaborate. To me
it was, and ever must be an enigma, how they contrived to spend so
much time in doing so little. The operation seemed close,
intricate, prolonged: the result simple. A clear white muslin
dress, a blue sash (the Virgin's colours), a pair of white, or
straw-colour kid gloves&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such was the gala
uniform, to the assumption whereof that houseful of teachers and
pupils devoted three mortal hours. But though simple, it must be
allowed the array was perfect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perfect in
fashion, fit, and freshness; every head being also dressed with
exquisite nicety, and a certain compact
taste&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;suiting the full, firm comeliness of
Labassecourien contours, though too stiff for any more flowing and
flexible style of beauty&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the general effect was,
on the whole, commendable.</p>
<p id="id00918">In beholding this diaphanous and snowy mass, I well
remember feeling myself to be a mere shadowy spot on a field of
light; the courage was not in me to put on a transparent white
dress: something thin I must wear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the weather
and rooms being too hot to give substantial fabrics sufferance, so
I had sought through a dozen shops till I lit upon a crape-like
material of purple-gray&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the colour, in short, of
dun mist, lying on a moor in bloom. My <i>tailleuse</i> had kindly
made it as well as she could: because, as she judiciously observed,
it was "si triste&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;si pen voyant," care in the
fashion was the more imperative: it was well she took this view of
the matter, for I, had no flower, no jewel to relieve it: and, what
was more, I had no natural rose of complexion.</p>
<p id="id00919">We become oblivious of these deficiencies in the
uniform routine of daily drudgery, but they <i>will</i> force upon
us their unwelcome blank on those bright occasions when beauty
should shine.</p>
<p id="id00920">However, in this same gown of shadow, I felt at
home and at ease; an advantage I should not have enjoyed in
anything more brilliant or striking. Madame Beck, too, kept me in
countenance; her dress was almost as quiet as mine, except that she
wore a bracelet, and a large brooch bright with gold and fine
stones. We chanced to meet on the stairs, and she gave me a nod and
smile of approbation. Not that she thought I was looking
well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a point unlikely to engage her
interest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but she considered me dressed
"convenablement," "d&Atilde;&copy;cemment," and la Convenance et la
D&Atilde;&copy;cence were the two calm deities of Madame's worship.
She even paused, laid on my shoulder her gloved hand, holding an
embroidered and perfumed handkerchief, and confided to my ear a
sarcasm on the other teachers (whom she had just been complimenting
to their faces). "Nothing so absurd," she said, "as for des femmes
m&Atilde;&raquo;res 'to dress themselves like girls of
fifteen'&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quant &Atilde;&nbsp; la. St. Pierre,
elle a l'air d'une vieille coquette qui fait
l'ing&Atilde;&copy;nue."</p>
<p id="id00921">Being dressed at least a couple of hours before
anybody else, I felt a pleasure in betaking
myself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not to the garden, where servants were
busy propping up long tables, placing seats, and spreading cloths
in readiness for the collation but to the schoolrooms, now empty,
quiet, cool, and clean; their walls fresh stained, their planked
floors fresh scoured and scarce dry; flowers fresh gathered
adorning the recesses in pots, and draperies, fresh hung,
beautifying the great windows.</p>
<p id="id00922">Withdrawing to the first classe, a smaller and
neater room than the others, and taking from the glazed bookcase,
of which I kept the key, a volume whose title promised some
interest, I sat down to read. The glass-door of this "classe," or
schoolroom, opened into the large berceau; acacia-boughs caressed
its panes, as they stretched across to meet a rose-bush blooming by
the opposite lintel: in this rose-bush bees murmured busy and
happy. I commenced reading. Just as the stilly hum, the embowering
shade, the warm, lonely calm of my retreat were beginning to steal
meaning from the page, vision from my eyes, and to lure me along
the track of reverie, down into some deep dell of
dreamland&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;just then, the sharpest ring of the
street-door bell to which that much-tried instrument had ever
thrilled, snatched me back to consciousness.</p>
<p id="id00923">Now the bell had been ringing all the morning, as
workmen, or servants, or <i>coiffeurs</i>, or <i>tailleuses</i>,
went and came on their several errands. Moreover, there was good
reason to expect it would ring all the afternoon, since about one
hundred externes were yet to arrive in carriages or fiacres: nor
could it be expected to rest during the evening, when parents and
friends would gather thronging to the play. Under these
circumstances, a ring&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even a sharp
ring&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was a matter of course: yet this particular
peal had an accent of its own, which chased my dream, and startled
my book from my knee.</p>
<p id="id00924">I was stooping to pick up this last,
when&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;firm, fast,
straight&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;right on through
vestibule&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;along corridor, across
carr&Atilde;&copy;, through first division, second division, grand
salle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strode a step, quick, regular, intent. The
closed door of the first classe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my
sanctuary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;offered no obstacle; it burst open,
and a palet&Atilde;&acute;t and a bonnet grec filled the void; also
two eyes first vaguely struck upon, and then hungrily dived into
me.</p>
<p id="id00925">"C'est cela!" said a voice. "Je la connais: c'est
l'Anglaise. Tant pis. Toute Anglaise, et, par
cons&Atilde;&copy;quent, toute b&Atilde;&copy;gueule qu'elle
soit&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;elle fera mon affaire, ou je saurai
pourquoi."</p>
<p id="id00926">Then, with a certain stern politeness (I suppose he
thought I had not caught the drift of his previous uncivil
mutterings), and in a jargon the most execrable that ever was
heard, "Meess&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;, play you
must: I am planted there."</p>
<p id="id00927">"What can I do for you, M. Paul Emanuel?" I
inquired: for M. Paul<br />
Emanuel it was, and in a state of no little excitement.<br /></p>
<p id="id00928">"Play you must. I will not have you shrink, or
frown, or make the prude. I read your skull that night you came; I
see your moyens: play you can; play you must."</p>
<p id="id00929">"But how, M. Paul? What do you mean?"</p>
<p id="id00930">"There is no time to be lost," he went on, now
speaking in French; "and let us thrust to the wall all reluctance,
all excuses, all minauderies. You must take a part."</p>
<p id="id00931">"In the vaudeville?"</p>
<p id="id00932">"In the vaudeville. You have said it."</p>
<p id="id00933">I gasped, horror-struck. <i>What</i> did the little
man mean?</p>
<p id="id00934">"Listen!" he said. "The case shall be stated, and
you shall then answer me Yes, or No; and according to your answer
shall I ever after estimate you."</p>
<p id="id00935">The scarce-suppressed impetus of a most irritable
nature glowed in his cheek, fed with sharp shafts his glances, a
nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the injudicious, the mawkish, the
hesitating, the sullen, the affected, above all, the unyielding,
might quickly render violent and implacable. Silence and attention
was the best balm to apply: I listened.</p>
<p id="id00936">"The whole matter is going to fail," he began.
"Louise Vanderkelkov has fallen ill&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at least so
her ridiculous mother asserts; for my part, I feel sure she might
play if she would: it is only good-will that lacks. She was charged
with a <i>r&Atilde;&acute;le</i>, as you know, or do <i>not</i>
know&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is equal: without that
<i>r&Atilde;&acute;le</i> the play is stopped. There are now but a
few hours in which to learn it: not a girl in this school would
hear reason, and accept the task. Forsooth, it is not an
interesting, not an amiable, part; their vile
<i>amour-propre</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that base quality of which
women have so much&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;would revolt from it.
Englishwomen are either the best or the worst of their sex. Dieu
sait que je les d&Atilde;&copy;teste comme la peste, ordinairement"
(this between his recreant teeth). "I apply to an Englishwoman to
rescue me. What is her answer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Yes, or No?"</p>
<p id="id00937">A thousand objections rushed into my mind. The
foreign language, the limited time, the public
display&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; Inclination recoiled, Ability
faltered, Self-respect (that "vile quality") trembled. "Non, non,
non!" said all these; but looking up at M. Paul, and seeing in his
vexed, fiery, and searching eye, a sort of appeal behind all its
menace, my lips dropped the word "oui". For a moment his rigid
countenance relaxed with a quiver of content: quickly bent up
again, however, he went on,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id00938">"Vite &Atilde;&nbsp; l'ouvrage! Here is the book;
here is your <i>r&Atilde;&acute;le</i>: read." And I read. He did
not commend; at some passages he scowled and stamped. He gave me a
lesson: I diligently imitated. It was a disagreeable
part&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a man's&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an empty-headed
fop's. One could put into it neither heart nor soul: I hated it.
The play&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a mere trifle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ran
chiefly on the efforts of a brace of rivals to gain the hand of a
fair coquette. One lover was called the "Ours," a good and gallant
but unpolished man, a sort of diamond in the rough; the other was a
butterfly, a talker, and a traitor: and I was to be the butterfly,
talker, and traitor.</p>
<p id="id00939">I did my best&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which was bad, I
know: it provoked M. Paul; he fumed. Putting
both&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hands to the work, I endeavoured to do
better than my best; I presume he gave me credit for good
intentions; he professed to be partially content. "Ca ira!" he
cried; and as voices began sounding from the garden, and white
dresses fluttering among the trees, he added: "You must withdraw:
you must be alone to learn this. Come with me."</p>
<p id="id00940">Without being allowed time or power to deliberate,
I found myself in the same breath convoyed along as in a species of
whirlwind, up-stairs, up two pair of stairs, nay, actually up three
(for this fiery little man seemed as by instinct to know his way
everywhere); to the solitary and lofty attic was I borne, put in
and locked in, the key being, in the door, and that key he took
with him and vanished.</p>
<p id="id00941">The attic was no pleasant place: I believe he did
not know how unpleasant it was, or he never would have locked me in
with so little ceremony. In this summer weather, it was hot as
Africa; as in winter, it was always cold as Greenland. Boxes and
lumber filled it; old dresses draped its unstained
wall&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;cobwebs its unswept ceiling. Well was it
known to be tenanted by rats, by black beetles, and by
cockroaches&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nay, rumour affirmed that the
ghostly Nun of the garden had once been seen here. A partial
darkness obscured one end, across which, as for deeper mystery, an
old russet curtain was drawn, by way of screen to a sombre band of
winter cloaks, pendent each from its pin, like a malefactor from
his gibbet. From amongst these cloaks, and behind that curtain, the
Nun was said to issue. I did not believe this, nor was I troubled
by apprehension thereof; but I saw a very dark and large rat, with
a long tail, come gliding out from that squalid alcove; and,
moreover, my eye fell on many a black-beetle, dotting the floor.
These objects discomposed me more, perhaps, than it would be wise
to say, as also did the dust, lumber, and stifling heat of the
place. The last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable,
had I not found means to open and prop up the skylight, thus
admitting some freshness. Underneath this aperture I pushed a large
empty chest, and having mounted upon it a smaller box, and wiped
from both the dust, I gathered my dress (my best, the reader must
remember, and therefore a legitimate object of care) fastidiously
around me, ascended this species of extempore throne, and being
seated, commenced the acquisition of my task; while I learned, not
forgetting to keep a sharp look-out on the black-beetles and
cockroaches, of which, more even, I believe, than of the rats, I
sat in mortal dread.</p>
<p id="id00942">My impression at first was that I had undertaken
what it really was impossible to perform, and I simply resolved to
do my best and be resigned to fail. I soon found, however, that one
part in so short a piece was not more than memory could master at a
few hours' notice. I learned and learned on, first in a whisper,
and then aloud. Perfectly secure from human audience, I acted my
part before the garret-vermin. Entering into its emptiness,
frivolity, and falsehood, with a spirit inspired by scorn and
impatience, I took my revenge on this "fat," by making him as
fatuitous as I possibly could.</p>
<p id="id00943">In this exercise the afternoon passed: day began to
glide into evening; and I, who had eaten nothing since breakfast,
grew excessively hungry. Now I thought of the collation, which
doubtless they were just then devouring in the garden far below. (I
had seen in the vestibule a basketful of small
<i>p&Atilde;&cent;t&Atilde;&copy;s &Atilde;&nbsp; la
cr&Atilde;&ordf;me</i>, than which nothing in the whole range of
cookery seemed to me better). A
<i>p&Atilde;&cent;t&Atilde;&copy;</i>, or a square of cake, it
seemed to me would come very <i>&Atilde;&nbsp;propos;</i> and as my
relish for those dainties increased, it began to appear somewhat
hard that I should pass my holiday, fasting and in prison. Remote
as was the attic from the street-door and vestibule, yet the
ever-tinkling bell was faintly audible here; and also the ceaseless
roll of wheels, on the tormented pavement. I knew that the house
and garden were thronged, and that all was gay and glad below; here
it began to grow dusk: the beetles were fading from my sight; I
trembled lest they should steal on me a march, mount my throne
unseen, and, unsuspected, invade my skirts. Impatient and
apprehensive, I recommenced the rehearsal of my part merely to kill
time. Just as I was concluding, the long-delayed rattle of the key
in the lock came to my ear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no unwelcome sound.
M. Paul (I could just see through the dusk that it <i>was</i> M.
Paul, for light enough still lingered to show the velvet blackness
of his close-shorn head, and the sallow ivory of his brow) looked
in.</p>
<p id="id00944">"Brava!" cried he, holding the door open and
remaining at the threshold. "J'ai tout entendu. C'est assez bien.
Encore!"</p>
<p id="id00945">A moment I hesitated.</p>
<p id="id00946">"Encore!" said he sternly. "Et point de grimaces! A
bas la timidit&Atilde;&copy;!"</p>
<p id="id00947">Again I went through the part, but not half so well
as I had spoken it alone.</p>
<p id="id00948">"Enfin, elle sait," said he, half dissatisfied,
"and one cannot be fastidious or exacting under the circumstances."
Then he added, "You may yet have twenty minutes for preparation: au
revoir!" And he was going.</p>
<p id="id00949">"Monsieur," I called out, taking courage.</p>
<p id="id00950">"Eh bien! Qu'est-ce que c'est, Mademoiselle?"</p>
<p id="id00951">"J'ai bien faim."</p>
<p id="id00952">"Comment, vous avez faim! Et la collation?"</p>
<p id="id00953">"I know nothing about it. I have not seen it, shut
up here."</p>
<p id="id00954">"Ah! C'est vrai," cried he.</p>
<p id="id00955">In a moment my throne was abdicated, the attic
evacuated; an inverse repetition of the impetus which had brought
me up into the attic, instantly took me
down&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;down&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;down to the very
kitchen. I thought I should have gone to the cellar. The cook was
imperatively ordered to produce food, and I, as imperatively, was
commanded to eat. To my great joy this food was limited to coffee
and cake: I had feared wine and sweets, which I did not like. How
he guessed that I should like a <i>petit
p&Atilde;&cent;t&Atilde;&copy; &Atilde;&nbsp; la
cr&Atilde;&ordf;me</i> I cannot tell; but he went out and procured
me one from some quarter. With considerable willingness I ate and
drank, keeping the <i>petit p&Atilde;&cent;t&Atilde;&copy;</i> till
the last, as a <i>bonne bouche</i>. M. Paul superintended my
repast, and almost forced upon me more than I could swallow.</p>
<p id="id00956">"A la bonne heure," he cried, when I signified that
I really could take no more, and, with uplifted hands, implored to
be spared the additional roll on which he had just spread butter.
"You will set me down as a species of tyrant and Bluebeard,
starving women in a garret; whereas, after all, I am no such thing.
Now, Mademoiselle, do you feel courage and strength to appear?"</p>
<p id="id00957">I said, I thought I did; though, in truth, I was
perfectly confused, and could hardly tell how I felt: but this
little man was of the order of beings who must not be opposed,
unless you possessed an all-dominant force sufficient to crush him
at once.</p>
<p id="id00958">"Come then," said he, offering his hand.</p>
<p id="id00959">I gave him mine, and he set off with a rapid walk,
which obliged me to run at his side in order to keep pace. In the
carr&Atilde;&copy; he stopped a moment: it was lit with large
lamps; the wide doors of the classes were open, and so were the
equally wide garden-doors; orange-trees in tubs, and tall flowers
in pots, ornamented these portals on each side; groups of ladies
and gentlemen in evening-dress stood and walked amongst the
flowers. Within, the long vista of the school-rooms presented a
thronging, undulating, murmuring, waving, streaming multitude, all
rose, and blue, and half translucent white. There were lustres
burning overhead; far off there was a stage, a solemn green
curtain, a row of footlights.</p>
<p id="id00960">"Nest-ce pas que c'est beau?" demanded my
companion.</p>
<p id="id00961">I should have said it was, but my heart got up into
my throat. M. Paul discovered this, and gave me a side-scowl and a
little shake for my pains.</p>
<p id="id00962">"I will do my best, but I wish it was over," said
I; then I asked: "Are we to walk through that crowd?"</p>
<p id="id00963">"By no means: I manage matters better: we pass
through the garden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;here."</p>
<p id="id00964">In an instant we were out of doors: the cool, calm
night revived me somewhat. It was moonless, but the reflex from the
many glowing windows lit the court brightly, and even the
alleys&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dimly. Heaven was cloudless, and grand
with the quiver of its living fires. How soft are the nights of the
Continent! How bland, balmy, safe! No sea-fog; no chilling damp:
mistless as noon, and fresh as morning.</p>
<p id="id00965">Having crossed court and garden, we reached the
glass door of the first classe. It stood open, like all other doors
that night; we passed, and then I was ushered into a small cabinet,
dividing the first classe from the grand salle. This cabinet
dazzled me, it was so full of light: it deafened me, it was
clamorous with voices: it stifled me, it was so hot, choking,
thronged.</p>
<p id="id00966">"De l'ordre! Du silence!" cried M. Paul. "Is this
chaos?", he demanded; and there was a hush. With a dozen words, and
as many gestures, he turned out half the persons present, and
obliged the remnant to fall into rank. Those left were all in
costume: they were the performers, and this was the green-room. M.
Paul introduced me. All stared and some tittered. It was a
surprise: they had not expected the Englishwoman would play in a
<i>vaudeville</i>. Ginevra Fanshawe, beautifully dressed for her
part, and looking fascinatingly pretty, turned on me a pair of eyes
as round as beads. In the highest spirit, unperturbed by fear or
bashfulness, delighted indeed at the thought of shining off before
hundreds&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my entrance seemed to transfix her with
amazement in the midst of her joy. She would have exclaimed, but M.
Paul held her and all the rest in check.</p>
<p id="id00967">Having surveyed and criticized the whole troop, he
turned to me.</p>
<p id="id00968">"You, too, must be dressed for your part."</p>
<p id="id00969">"Dressed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dressed like a man!"
exclaimed Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St. Pierre, darting forwards; adding
with officiousness, "I will dress her myself."</p>
<p id="id00970">To be dressed like a man did not please, and would
not suit me. I had consented to take a man's name and part; as to
his dress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>halte l&Atilde;&nbsp;!</i> No. I
would keep my own dress, come what might. M. Paul might storm,
might rage: I would keep my own dress. I said so, with a voice as
resolute in intent, as it was low, and perhaps unsteady in
utterance.</p>
<p id="id00971">He did not immediately storm or rage, as I fully
thought he would he stood silent. But Z&Atilde;&copy;lie again
interposed.</p>
<p id="id00972">"She will make a capital
<i>petit-m&Atilde;&cent;itre</i>. Here are the garments,
all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all complete: somewhat too large,
but&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I will arrange all that. Come,
ch&Atilde;&uml;re amie&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;belle Anglaise!"</p>
<p id="id00973">And she sneered, for I was not "belle." She seized
my hand, she was drawing me away. M. Paul stood
impassable&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;neutral.</p>
<p id="id00974">"You must not resist," pursued St.
Pierre&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for resist I did. "You will spoil all,
destroy the mirth of the piece, the enjoyment of the company,
sacrifice everything to your <i>amour-propre</i>. This would be too
bad&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;monsieur will never permit this?"</p>
<p id="id00975">She sought his eye. I watched, likewise, for a
glance. He gave her one, and then he gave me one. "Stop!" he said
slowly, arresting St. Pierre, who continued her efforts to drag me
after her. Everybody awaited the decision. He was not angry, not
irritated; I perceived that, and took heart.</p>
<p id="id00976">"You do not like these clothes?" he asked, pointing
to the masculine vestments.</p>
<p id="id00977">"I don't object to some of them, but I won't have
them all."</p>
<p id="id00978">"How must it be, then? How accept a man's part, and
go on the stage dressed as a woman? This is an amateur affair, it
is true&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a <i>vaudeville de pensionnat;</i>
certain modifications I might sanction, yet something you must have
to announce you as of the nobler sex."</p>
<p id="id00979">"And I will, Monsieur; but it must be arranged in
my own way: nobody must meddle; the things must not be forced upon
me. Just let me dress myself."</p>
<p id="id00980">Monsieur, without another word, took the costume
from St. Pierre, gave it to me, and permitted me to pass into the
dressing-room. Once alone, I grew calm, and collectedly went to
work. Retaining my woman's garb without the slightest retrenchment,
I merely assumed, in addition, a little vest, a collar, and cravat,
and a palet&Atilde;&acute;t of small dimensions; the whole being
the costume of a brother of one of the pupils. Having loosened my
hair out of its braids, made up the long back-hair close, and
brushed the front hair to one side, I took my hat and gloves in my
hand and came out. M. Paul was waiting, and so were the others. He
looked at me. "That may pass in a pensionnat," he pronounced. Then
added, not unkindly, "Courage, mon ami! Un peu de
sangfroid&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;un peu d'aplomb, M. Lucien, et tout
ira bien."</p>
<p id="id00981">St. Pierre sneered again, in her cold snaky
manner.</p>
<p id="id00982">I was irritable, because excited, and I could not
help turning upon her and saying, that if she were not a lady and I
a gentleman, I should feel disposed to call her out.</p>
<p id="id00983">"After the play, after the play," said M. Paul. "I
will then divide my pair of pistols between you, and we will settle
the dispute according to form: it will only be the old quarrel of
France and England."</p>
<p id="id00984">But now the moment approached for the performance
to commence. M. Paul, setting us before him, harangued us briefly,
like a general addressing soldiers about to charge. I don't know
what he said, except that he recommended each to penetrate herself
with a sense of her personal insignificance. God knows I thought
this advice superfluous for some of us. A bell tinkled. I and two
more were ushered on to the stage. The bell tinkled again. I had to
speak the very first words.</p>
<p id="id00985">"Do not look at the crowd, nor think of it,"
whispered M. Paul in my ear. "Imagine yourself in the garret,
acting to the rats."</p>
<p id="id00986">He vanished. The curtain drew
up&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shrivelled to the ceiling: the bright lights,
the long room, the gay throng, burst upon us. I thought of the
black-beetles, the old boxes, the worm-eaten bureau. I said my say
badly; but I said it. That first speech was the difficulty; it
revealed to me this fact, that it was not the crowd I feared so
much as my own voice. Foreigners and strangers, the crowd were
nothing to me. Nor did I think of them. When my tongue once got
free, and my voice took its true pitch, and found its natural tone,
I thought of nothing but the personage I
represented&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and of M. Paul, who was listening,
watching, prompting in the side-scenes.</p>
<p id="id00987">By-and-by, feeling the right power
come&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the spring demanded gush and rise
inwardly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I became sufficiently composed to
notice my fellow-actors. Some of them played very well; especially
Ginevra Fanshawe, who had to coquette between two suitors, and
managed admirably: in fact she was in her element. I observed that
she once or twice threw a certain marked fondness and pointed
partiality into her manner towards me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the fop.
With such emphasis and animation did she favour me, such glances
did she dart out into the listening and applauding crowd, that to
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who knew her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it presently
became evident she was acting <i>at</i> some one; and I followed
her eye, her smile, her gesture, and ere long discovered that she
had at least singled out a handsome and distinguished aim for her
shafts; full in the path of those arrows&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;taller
than other spectators, and therefore more sure to receive
them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stood, in attitude quiet but intent, a
well-known form&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that of Dr. John.</p>
<p id="id00988">The spectacle seemed somehow suggestive. There was
language in Dr. John's look, though I cannot tell what he said; it
animated me: I drew out of it a history; I put my idea into the
part I per formed; I threw it into my wooing of Ginevra. In the
"Ours," or sincere lover, I saw Dr. John. Did I pity him, as erst?
No, I hardened my heart, rivalled and out-rivalled him. I knew
myself but a fop, but where <i>he</i> was outcast <i>I</i> could
please. Now I know acted as if wishful and resolute to win and
conquer. Ginevra seconded me; between us we half-changed the nature
of the <i>r&Atilde;&acute;le</i>, gilding it from top to toe.
Between the acts M. Paul, told us he knew not what possessed us,
and half expostulated. "C'est peut-&Atilde;&ordf;tre plus beau que
votre mod&Atilde;&uml;le," said he, "mais ce n'est pas juste." I
know not what possessed me either; but somehow, my longing was to
eclipse the "Ours," <i>i.e.</i>, Dr. John. Ginevra was tender; how
could I be otherwise than chivalric? Retaining the letter, I
recklessly altered the spirit of the <i>r&Atilde;&acute;le</i>.
Without heart, without interest, I could not play it at all. It
must be played&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in went the yearned-for
seasoning&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;thus favoured, I played it with
relish.</p>
<p id="id00989">What I felt that night, and what I did, I no more
expected to feel and do, than to be lifted in a trance to the
seventh heaven. Cold, reluctant, apprehensive, I had accepted a
part to please another: ere long, warming, becoming interested,
taking courage, I acted to please myself. Yet the next day, when I
thought it over, I quite disapproved of these amateur performances;
and though glad that I had obliged M. Paul, and tried my own
strength for once, I took a firm resolution, never to be drawn into
a similar affair. A keen relish for dramatic expression had
revealed itself as part of my nature; to cherish and exercise this
new-found faculty might gift me with a world of delight, but it
would not do for a mere looker-on at life: the strength and longing
must be put by; and I put them by, and fastened them in with the
lock of a resolution which neither Time nor Temptation has since
picked.</p>
<p id="id00990">No sooner was the play over, and <i>well</i> over,
than the choleric and arbitrary M. Paul underwent a metamorphosis.
His hour of managerial responsibility past, he at once laid aside
his magisterial austerity; in a moment he stood amongst us,
vivacious, kind, and social, shook hands with us all round, thanked
us separately, and announced his determination that each of us
should in turn be his partner in the coming ball. On his claiming
my promise, I told him I did not dance. "For once I must," was the
answer; and if I had not slipped aside and kept out of his way, he
would have compelled me to this second performance. But I had acted
enough for one evening; it was time I retired into myself and my
ordinary life. My dun-coloured dress did well enough under a
palet&Atilde;&acute;t on the stage, but would not suit a waltz or a
quadrille. Withdrawing to a quiet nook, whence unobserved I could
observe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the ball, its splendours and its
pleasures, passed before me as a spectacle.</p>
<p id="id00991">Again Ginevra Fanshawe was the belle, the fairest
and the gayest present; she was selected to open the ball: very
lovely she looked, very gracefully she danced, very joyously she
smiled. Such scenes were her triumphs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she was
the child of pleasure. Work or suffering found her listless and
dejected, powerless and repining; but gaiety expanded her
butterfly's wings, lit up their gold-dust and bright spots, made
her flash like a gem, and flush like a flower. At all ordinary diet
and plain beverage she would pout; but she fed on creams and ices
like a humming-bird on honey-paste: sweet wine was her element, and
sweet cake her daily bread. Ginevra lived her full life in a
ball-room; elsewhere she drooped dispirited.</p>
<p id="id00992">Think not, reader, that she thus bloomed and
sparkled for the mere sake of M. Paul, her partner, or that she
lavished her best graces that night for the edification of her
companions only, or for that of the parents and grand-parents, who
filled the carr&Atilde;&copy;, and lined the ball-room; under
circumstances so insipid and limited, with motives so chilly and
vapid, Ginevra would scarce have deigned to walk one quadrille, and
weariness and fretfulness would have replaced animation and
good-humour, but she knew of a leaven in the otherwise heavy festal
mass which lighted the whole; she tasted a condiment which gave it
zest; she perceived reasons justifying the display of her choicest
attractions.</p>
<p id="id00993">In the ball-room, indeed, not a single male
spectator was to be seen who was not married and a
father&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;M. Paul excepted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
gentleman, too, being the sole creature of his sex permitted to
lead out a pupil to the dance; and this exceptional part was
allowed him, partly as a matter of old-established custom (for he
was a kinsman of Madame Beck's, and high in her confidence), partly
because he would always have his own way and do as he pleased, and
partly because&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wilful, passionate, partial, as
he might be&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was the soul of honour, and might
be trusted with a regiment of the fairest and purest; in perfect
security that under his leadership they would come to no harm. Many
of the girls&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it may be noted in
parenthesis&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were not pure-minded at all, very
much otherwise; but they no more dare betray their natural
coarseness in M. Paul's presence, than they dare tread purposely on
his corns, laugh in his face during a stormy apostrophe, or speak
above their breath while some crisis of irritability was covering
his human visage with the mask of an intelligent tiger. M. Paul,
then, might dance with whom he would&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and woe be
to the interference which put him out of step.</p>
<p id="id00994">Others there were admitted as
spectators&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with (seeming) reluctance, through
prayers, by influence, under restriction, by special and difficult
exercise of Madame Beck's gracious good-nature, and whom she all
the evening&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with her own personal
surveillance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;kept far aloof at the remotest,
drearest, coldest, darkest side of the
carr&Atilde;&copy;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a small, forlorn band of
"jeunes gens;" these being all of the best families, grown-up sons
of mothers present, and whose sisters were pupils in the school.
That whole evening was Madame on duty beside these "jeunes
gens"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;attentive to them as a mother, but strict
with them as a dragon. There was a sort of cordon stretched before
them, which they wearied her with prayers to be permitted to pass,
and just to revive themselves by one dance with that "belle
blonde," or that "jolie brune," or "cette jeune fille magnifique
aux cheveux noirs comme le jais."</p>
<p id="id00995">"Taisez-vous!" Madame would reply, heroically and
inexorably. "Vous ne passerez pas &Atilde;&nbsp; moins que ce ne
soit sur mon cadavre, et vous ne danserez qu'avec la nonnette du
jardin" (alluding to the legend). And she majestically walked to
and fro along their disconsolate and impatient line, like a little
Bonaparte in a mouse-coloured silk gown.</p>
<p id="id00996">Madame knew something of the world; Madame knew
much of human nature. I don't think that another directress in
Villette would have dared to admit a "jeune homme" within her
walls; but Madame knew that by granting such admission, on an
occasion like the present, a bold stroke might be struck, and a
great point gained.</p>
<p id="id00997">In the first place, the parents were made
accomplices to the deed, for it was only through their mediation it
was brought about. Secondly: the admission of these rattlesnakes,
so fascinating and so dangerous, served to draw out Madame
precisely in her strongest character&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that of a
first-rate <i>surveillante</i>. Thirdly: their presence furnished a
most piquant ingredient to the entertainment: the pupils knew it,
and saw it, and the view of such golden apples shining afar off,
animated them with a spirit no other circumstance could have
kindled. The children's pleasure spread to the parents; life and
mirth circulated quickly round the ball-room; the "jeunes gens"
themselves, though restrained, were amused: for Madame never
permitted them to feel dull&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and thus Madame
Beck's f&Atilde;&ordf;te annually ensured a success unknown to the
f&Atilde;&ordf;te of any other directress in the land.</p>
<p id="id00998">I observed that Dr. John was at first permitted to
walk at large through the classes: there was about him a manly,
responsible look, that redeemed his youth, and half-expiated his
beauty; but as soon as the ball began, Madame ran up to him.</p>
<p id="id00999">"Come, Wolf; come," said she, laughing: "you wear
sheep's clothing, but you must quit the fold notwithstanding. Come;
I have a fine menagerie of twenty here in the carr&Atilde;&copy;:
let me place you amongst my collection."</p>
<p id="id01000">"But first suffer me to have one dance with one
pupil of my choice."</p>
<p id="id01001">"Have you the face to ask such a thing? It is
madness: it is impiety.<br />
Sortez, sortez, au plus vite."<br /></p>
<p id="id01002">She drove him before her, and soon had him enclosed
within the cordon.</p>
<p id="id01003">Ginevra being, I suppose, tired with dancing,
sought me out in my retreat. She threw herself on the bench beside
me, and (a demonstration I could very well have dispensed with)
cast her arms round my neck.</p>
<p id="id01004">"Lucy Snowe! Lucy Snowe!" she cried in a somewhat
sobbing voice, half hysterical.</p>
<p id="id01005">"What in the world is the matter?" I drily
said.</p>
<p id="id01006">"How do I look&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how do I look
to-night?" she demanded.</p>
<p id="id01007">"As usual," said I; "preposterously vain."</p>
<p id="id01008">"Caustic creature! You never have a kind word for
me; but in spite of you, and all other envious detractors, I know I
am beautiful; I feel it, I see it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for there is a
great looking-glass in the dressing-room, where I can view my shape
from head to foot. Will you go with me now, and let us two stand
before it?"</p>
<p id="id01009">"I will, Miss Fanshawe: you shall be humoured even
to the top of your bent."</p>
<p id="id01010">The dressing-room was very near, and we stepped in.
Putting her arm through mine, she drew me to the mirror. Without
resistance remonstrance, or remark, I stood and let her self-love
have its feast and triumph: curious to see how much it could
swallow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether it was possible it could feed to
satiety&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether any whisper of consideration for
others could penetrate her heart, and moderate its vainglorious
exultation.</p>
<p id="id01011">Not at all. She turned me and herself round; she
viewed us both on all sides; she smiled, she waved her curls, she
retouched her sash, she spread her dress, and finally, letting go
my arm, and curtseying with mock respect, she said: "I would not be
you for a kingdom."</p>
<p id="id01012">The remark was too <i>na&Atilde;&macr;ve</i> to
rouse anger; I merely said: "Very good."</p>
<p id="id01013">"And what would <i>you</i> give to be ME?" she
inquired.</p>
<p id="id01014">"Not a bad sixpence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strange as
it may sound," I replied. "You are but a poor creature."</p>
<p id="id01015">"You don't think so in your heart."</p>
<p id="id01016">"No; for in my heart you have not the outline of a
place: I only occasionally turn you over in my brain."</p>
<p id="id01017">"Well, but," said she, in an expostulatory tone,
"just listen to the difference of our positions, and then see how
happy am I, and how miserable are you."</p>
<p id="id01018">"Go on; I listen."</p>
<p id="id01019">"In the first place: I am the daughter of a
gentleman of family, and though my father is not rich, I have
expectations from an uncle. Then, I am just eighteen, the finest
age possible. I have had a continental education, and though I
can't spell, I have abundant accomplishments. I <i>am</i> pretty;
<i>you</i> can't deny that; I may have as many admirers as I
choose. This very night I have been breaking the hearts of two
gentlemen, and it is the dying look I had from one of them just
now, which puts me in such spirits. I do so like to watch them turn
red and pale, and scowl and dart fiery glances at each other, and
languishing ones at me. There is <i>me</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;happy
ME; now for <i>you</i>, poor soul!</p>
<p id="id01020">"I suppose you are nobody's daughter, since you
took care of little children when you first came to Villette: you
have no relations; you can't call yourself young at twenty-three;
you have no attractive accomplishments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no
beauty. As to admirers, you hardly know what they are; you can't
even talk on the subject: you sit dumb when the other teachers
quote their conquests. I believe you never were in love, and never
will be: you don't know the feeling, and so much the better, for
though you might have your own heart broken, no living heart will
you ever break. Isn't it all true?"</p>
<p id="id01021">"A good deal of it is true as gospel, and shrewd
besides. There must be good in you, Ginevra, to speak so honestly;
that snake, Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St. Pierre, could not utter what you
have uttered. Still, Miss Fanshawe, hapless as I am, according to
your showing, sixpence I would not give to purchase you, body and
soul."</p>
<p id="id01022">"Just because I am not clever, and that is all
<i>you</i> think of. Nobody in the world but you cares for
cleverness."</p>
<p id="id01023">"On the contrary, I consider you <i>are</i> clever,
in your way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;very smart indeed. But you were
talking of breaking hearts&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that edifying
amusement into the merits of which I don't quite enter; pray on
whom does your vanity lead you to think you have done execution
to-night?"</p>
<p id="id01024">She approached her lips to my
ear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Isidore and Alfred de Hamal are both here?"
she whispered.</p>
<p id="id01025">"Oh! they are? I should like to see them."</p>
<p id="id01026">"There's a dear creature! your curiosity is roused
at last. Follow me,<br />
I will point them out."<br /></p>
<p id="id01027">She proudly led the way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"But you
cannot see them well from the classes," said she, turning, "Madame
keeps them too far off. Let us cross the garden, enter by the
corridor, and get close to them behind: we shall be scolded if we
are seen, but never mind."</p>
<p id="id01028">For once, I did not mind. Through the garden we
went&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;penetrated into the corridor by a quiet
private entrance, and approaching the <i>carr&Atilde;&copy;</i>,
yet keeping in the corridor shade, commanded a near view of the
band of "jeunes gens."</p>
<p id="id01029">I believe I could have picked out the conquering de
Hamal even undirected. He was a straight-nosed, very
correct-featured little dandy. I say <i>little</i> dandy, though he
was not beneath the middle standard in stature; but his lineaments
were small, and so were his hands and feet; and he was pretty and
smooth, and as trim as a doll: so nicely dressed, so nicely curled,
so booted and gloved and cravated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was
charming indeed. I said so. "What, a dear personage!" cried I, and
commended Ginevra's taste warmly; and asked her what she thought de
Hamal might have done with the precious fragments of that heart she
had broken&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether he kept them in a scent-vial,
and conserved them in otto of roses? I observed, too, with deep
rapture of approbation, that the colonel's hands were scarce larger
than Miss Fanshawe's own, and suggested that this circumstance
might be convenient, as he could wear her gloves at a pinch. On his
dear curls, I told her I doated: and as to his low, Grecian brow,
and exquisite classic headpiece, I confessed I had no language to
do such perfections justice.</p>
<p id="id01030">"And if he were your lover?" suggested the cruelly
exultant Ginevra.</p>
<p id="id01031">"Oh! heavens, what bliss!" said I; "but do not be
inhuman, Miss Fanshawe: to put such thoughts into my head is like
showing poor outcast Cain a far, glimpse of Paradise."</p>
<p id="id01032">"You like him, then?"</p>
<p id="id01033">"As I like sweets, and jams, and comfits, and
conservatory flowers."</p>
<p id="id01034">Ginevra admired my taste, for all these things were
her adoration; she could then readily credit that they were mine
too.</p>
<p id="id01035">"Now for Isidore," I went on. I own I felt still
more curious to see him than his rival; but Ginevra was absorbed in
the latter.</p>
<p id="id01036">"Alfred was admitted here to-night," said she,
"through the influence of his aunt, Madame la Baronne de Dorlodot;
and now, having seen him, can you not understand why I have been in
such spirits all the evening, and acted so well, and danced with
such life, and why I am now happy as a queen? Dieu! Dieu! It was
such good fun to glance first at him and then at the other, and
madden them both."</p>
<p id="id01037">"But that other&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where is he?
Show me Isidore."</p>
<p id="id01038">"I don't like."</p>
<p id="id01039">"Why not?"</p>
<p id="id01040">"I am ashamed of him."</p>
<p id="id01041">"For what reason?"</p>
<p id="id01042">"Because&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;because" (in a whisper)
"he has such&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such whiskers,
orange&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;red&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there now!"</p>
<p id="id01043">"The murder is out," I subjoined. "Never mind, show
him all the same; I engage not to faint."</p>
<p id="id01044">She looked round. Just then an English voice spoke
behind her and me.</p>
<p id="id01045">"You are both standing in a draught; you must leave
this corridor."</p>
<p id="id01046">"There is no draught, Dr. John," said I,
turning.</p>
<p id="id01047">"She takes cold so easily," he pursued, looking at
Ginevra with extreme kindness. "She is delicate; she must be cared
for: fetch her a shawl."</p>
<p id="id01048">"Permit me to judge for myself," said Miss
Fanshawe, with hauteur. "I want no shawl."</p>
<p id="id01049">"Your dress is thin, you have been dancing, you are
heated."</p>
<p id="id01050">"Always preaching," retorted she; "always coddling
and admonishing."</p>
<p id="id01051">The answer Dr. John would have given did not come;
that his heart was hurt became evident in his eye; darkened, and
saddened, and pained, he turned a little aside, but was patient. I
knew where there were plenty of shawls near at hand; I ran and
fetched one.</p>
<p id="id01052">"She shall wear this, if I have strength to make
her," said I, folding it well round her muslin dress, covering
carefully her neck and her arms. "Is that Isidore?" I asked, in a
somewhat fierce whisper.</p>
<p id="id01053">She pushed up her lip, smiled, and nodded.</p>
<p id="id01054">"Is <i>that</i> Isidore?" I repeated, giving her a
shake: I could have given her a dozen.</p>
<p id="id01055">"C'est lui-m&Atilde;&ordf;me," said she. "How
coarse he is, compared with the<br />
Colonel-Count! And then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oh
ciel!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the whiskers!"<br /></p>
<p id="id01056">Dr. John now passed on.</p>
<p id="id01057">"The Colonel-Count!" I echoed. "The
doll&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the puppet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
manikin&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the poor inferior creature! A mere
lackey for Dr. John his valet, his foot-boy! Is it possible that
fine generous gentleman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;handsome as a
vision&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;offers you his honourable hand and
gallant heart, and promises to protect your flimsy person and
feckless mind through the storms and struggles of
life&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and you hang back&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you
scorn, you sting, you torture him! Have you power to do this? Who
gave you that power? Where is it? Does it lie all in your
beauty&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;your pink and white complexion, and your
yellow hair? Does this bind his soul at your feet, and bend his
neck under your yoke? Does this purchase for you his affection, his
tenderness, his thoughts, his hopes, his interest, his noble,
cordial love&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and will you not have it? Do you
scorn it? You are only dissembling: you are not in earnest: you
love him; you long for him; but you trifle with his heart to make
him more surely yours?"</p>
<p id="id01058">"Bah! How you run on! I don't understand half you
have said."</p>
<p id="id01059">I had got her out into the garden ere this. I now
set her down on a seat and told her she should not stir till she
had avowed which she meant in the end to
accept&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the man or the monkey.</p>
<p id="id01060">"Him you call the man," said she, "is bourgeois,
sandy-haired, and answers to the name of
John!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;cela suffit: je n'en veux pas. Colonel de
Hamal is a gentleman of excellent connections, perfect manners,
sweet appearance, with pale interesting face, and hair and eyes
like an Italian. Then too he is the most delightful company
possible&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a man quite in my way; not sensible and
serious like the other; but one with whom I can talk on equal
terms&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who does not plague and bore, and harass
me with depths, and heights, and passions, and talents for which I
have no taste. There now. Don't hold me so fast."</p>
<p id="id01061">I slackened my grasp, and she darted off. I did not
care to pursue her.</p>
<p id="id01062">Somehow I could not avoid returning once more in
the direction of the corridor to get another glimpse of Dr. John;
but I met him on the garden-steps, standing where the light from a
window fell broad. His well-proportioned figure was not to be
mistaken, for I doubt whether there was another in that assemblage
his equal. He carried his hat in his hand; his uncovered head, his
face and fine brow were most handsome and manly. <i>His</i>
features were not delicate, not slight like those of a woman, nor
were they cold, frivolous, and feeble; though well cut, they were
not so chiselled, so frittered away, as to lose in expression or
significance what they gained in unmeaning symmetry. Much feeling
spoke in them at times, and more sat silent in his eye. Such at
least were my thoughts of him: to me he seemed all this. An
inexpressible sense of wonder occupied me, as I looked at this man,
and reflected that <i>he</i> could not be slighted.</p>
<p id="id01063">It was, not my intention to approach or address him
in the garden, our terms of acquaintance not warranting such a
step; I had only meant to view him in the
crowd&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;myself unseen: coming upon him thus alone,
I withdrew. But he was looking out for me, or rather for her who
had been with me: therefore he descended the steps, and followed me
down the alley.</p>
<p id="id01064">"You know Miss Fanshawe? I have often wished to ask
whether you knew her," said he.</p>
<p id="id01065">"Yes: I know her."</p>
<p id="id01066">"Intimately?"</p>
<p id="id01067">"Quite as intimately as I wish."</p>
<p id="id01068">"What have you done with her now?"</p>
<p id="id01069">"Am I her keeper?" I felt inclined to ask; but I
simply answered, "I have shaken her well, and would have shaken her
better, but she escaped out of my hands and ran away."</p>
<p id="id01070">"Would you favour me," he asked, "by watching over
her this one evening, and observing that she does nothing
imprudent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;does not, for instance, run out into
the night-air immediately after dancing?"</p>
<p id="id01071">"I may, perhaps, look after her a little; since you
wish it; but she likes her own way too well to submit readily to
control."</p>
<p id="id01072">"She is so young, so thoroughly artless," said
he.</p>
<p id="id01073">"To me she is an enigma," I responded.</p>
<p id="id01074">"Is she?" he asked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;much
interested. "How?"</p>
<p id="id01075">"It would be difficult to say
how&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;difficult, at least, to tell <i>you</i>
how."</p>
<p id="id01076">"And why me?"</p>
<p id="id01077">"I wonder she is not better pleased that you are so
much her friend."</p>
<p id="id01078">"But she has not the slightest idea how much I
<i>am</i> her friend. That is precisely the point I cannot teach
her. May I inquire did she ever speak of me to you?"</p>
<p id="id01079">"Under the name of 'Isidore' she has talked about
you often; but I must add that it is only within the last ten
minutes I have discovered that you and 'Isidore' are identical. It
is only, Dr. John, within that brief space of time I have learned
that Ginevra Fanshawe is the person, under this roof, in whom you
have long been interested&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that she is the magnet
which attracts you to the Rue Fossette, that for her sake you
venture into this garden, and seek out caskets dropped by
rivals."</p>
<p id="id01080">"You know all?"</p>
<p id="id01081">"I know so much."</p>
<p id="id01082">"For more than a year I have been accustomed to
meet her in society. Mrs. Cholmondeley, her friend, is an
acquaintance of mine; thus I see her every Sunday. But you observed
that under the name of 'Isidore' she often spoke of me: may
I&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;without inviting you to a breach of
confidence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;inquire what was the tone, what the
feeling of her remarks? I feel somewhat anxious to know, being a
little tormented with uncertainty as to how I stand with her."</p>
<p id="id01083">"Oh, she varies: she shifts and changes like the
wind."</p>
<p id="id01084">"Still, you can gather some general
idea&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id01085">"I can," thought I, "but it would not do to
communicate that general idea to you. Besides, if I said she did
not love you, I know you would not believe me."</p>
<p id="id01086">"You are silent," he pursued. "I suppose you have
no good news to impart. No matter. If she feels for me positive
coldness and aversion, it is a sign I do not deserve her."</p>
<p id="id01087">"Do you doubt yourself? Do you consider yourself
the inferior of<br />
Colonel de Hamal?"<br /></p>
<p id="id01088">"I love Miss Fanshawe far more than de Hamal loves
any human being, and would care for and guard her better than he.
Respecting de Hamal, I fear she is under an illusion; the man's
character is known to me, all his antecedents, all his scrapes. He
is not worthy of your beautiful young friend."</p>
<p id="id01089">"My 'beautiful young friend' ought to know that,
and to know or feel who is worthy of her," said I. "If her beauty
or her brains will not serve her so far, she merits the sharp
lesson of experience."</p>
<p id="id01090">"Are you not a little severe?"</p>
<p id="id01091">"I am excessively severe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;more
severe than I choose to show you. You should hear the strictures
with which I favour my 'beautiful young friend,' only that you
would be unutterably shocked at my want of tender considerateness
for her delicate nature."</p>
<p id="id01092">"She is so lovely, one cannot but be loving towards
her. You&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;every woman older than herself, must
feel for such a simple, innocent, girlish fairy a sort of motherly
or elder-sisterly fondness. Graceful angel! Does not your heart
yearn towards her when she pours into your ear her pure, childlike
confidences? How you are privileged!" And he sighed.</p>
<p id="id01093">"I cut short these confidences somewhat abruptly
now and then," said I. "But excuse me, Dr. John, may I change the
theme for one instant? What a god-like person is that de Hamal!
What a nose on his face&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perfect! Model one in
putty or clay, you could not make a better or straighter, or
neater; and then, such classic lips and chin&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
his bearing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sublime."</p>
<p id="id01094">"De Hamal is an unutterable puppy, besides being a
very white-livered hero."</p>
<p id="id01095">"You, Dr. John, and every man of a less-refined
mould than he, must feel for him a sort of admiring affection, such
as Mars and the coarser deities may be supposed to have borne the
young, graceful Apollo."</p>
<p id="id01096">"An unprincipled, gambling little jackanapes!" said
Dr. John curtly, "whom, with one hand, I could lift up by the
waistband any day, and lay low in the kennel if I liked."</p>
<p id="id01097">"The sweet seraph!" said I. "What a cruel idea! Are
you not a little severe, Dr. John?"</p>
<p id="id01098">And now I paused. For the second time that night I
was going beyond myself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;venturing out of what I
looked on as my natural habits&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;speaking in an
unpremeditated, impulsive strain, which startled me strangely when
I halted to reflect. On rising that morning, had I anticipated that
before night I should have acted the part of a gay lover in a
vaudeville; and an hour after, frankly discussed with Dr. John the
question of his hapless suit, and rallied him on his illusions? I
had no more presaged such feats than I had looked forward to an
ascent in a balloon, or a voyage to Cape Horn.</p>
<p id="id01099">The Doctor and I, having paced down the walk, were
now returning; the reflex from the window again lit his face: he
smiled, but his eye was melancholy. How I wished that he could feel
heart's-ease! How I grieved that he brooded over pain, and pain
from such a cause! He, with his great advantages, <i>he</i> to love
in vain! I did not then know that the pensiveness of reverse is the
best phase for some minds; nor did I reflect that some herbs,
"though scentless when entire, yield fragrance when they're
bruised."</p>
<p id="id01100">"Do not be sorrowful, do not grieve," I broke out.
"If there is in Ginevra one spark of worthiness of your affection,
she will&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she <i>must</i> feel devotion in
return. Be cheerful, be hopeful, Dr. John. Who should hope, if not
you?"</p>
<p id="id01101">In return for this speech I
got&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what, it must be supposed, I
deserved&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a look of surprise: I thought also of
some disapprobation. We parted, and I went into the house very
chill. The clocks struck and the bells tolled midnight; people were
leaving fast: the f&Atilde;&ordf;te was over; the lamps were
fading. In another hour all the dwelling-house, and all the
pensionnat, were dark and hushed. I too was in bed, but not asleep.
To me it was not easy to sleep after a day of such excitement.</p>
<h2 id="id01102" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h5 id="id01103">THE LONG VACATION.</h5>
<p id="id01104" style="margin-top: 2em">Following Madame Beck's
f&Atilde;&ordf;te, with its three preceding weeks of relaxation,
its brief twelve hours' burst of hilarity and dissipation, and its
one subsequent day of utter languor, came a period of reaction; two
months of real application, of close, hard study. These two months,
being the last of the "ann&Atilde;&copy;e scolaire," were indeed
the only genuine working months in the year. To them was
procrastinated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;into them concentrated, alike by
professors, mistresses, and pupils&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the main
burden of preparation for the examinations preceding the
distribution of prizes. Candidates for rewards had then to work in
good earnest; masters and teachers had to set their shoulders to
the wheel, to urge on the backward, and diligently aid and train
the more promising. A showy demonstration&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
telling exhibition&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;must be got up for public
view, and all means were fair to this end.</p>
<p id="id01105">I scarcely noted how the other teachers went to
work; I had my own business to mind; and <i>my</i> task was not the
least onerous, being to imbue some ninety sets of brains with a due
tincture of what they considered a most complicated and difficult
science, that of the English language; and to drill ninety tongues
in what, for them, was an almost impossible
pronunciation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the lisping and hissing dentals of
the Isles.</p>
<p id="id01106">The examination-day arrived. Awful day! Prepared
for with anxious care, dressed for with silent
despatch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing vaporous or fluttering
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no white gauze or azure streamers; the
grave, close, compact was the order of the toilette. It seemed to
me that I was this day, especially doomed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
main burden and trial falling on me alone of all the female
teachers. The others were not expected to examine in the studies
they taught; the professor of literature, M. Paul, taking upon
himself this duty. He, this school autocrat, gathered all and
sundry reins into the hollow of his one hand; he irefully rejected
any colleague; he would not have help. Madame herself, who
evidently rather wished to undertake the examination in
geography&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her favourite study, which she taught
well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was forced to succumb, and be subordinate
to her despotic kinsman's direction. The whole staff of
instructors, male and female, he set aside, and stood on the
examiner's estrade alone. It irked him that he was forced to make
one exception to this rule. He could not manage English: he was
obliged to leave that branch of education in the English teacher's
hands; which he did, not without a flash of na&Atilde;&macr;ve
jealousy.</p>
<p id="id01107">A constant crusade against the "amour-propre" of
every human being but himself, was the crotchet of this able, but
fiery and grasping little man. He had a strong relish for public
representation in his own person, but an extreme abhorrence of the
like display in any other. He quelled, he kept down when he could;
and when he could not, he fumed like a bottled storm.</p>
<p id="id01108">On the evening preceding the examination-day, I was
walking in the garden, as were the other teachers and all the
boarders. M. Emanuel joined me in the "all&Atilde;&copy;e
d&Atilde;&copy;fendue;" his cigar was at his lips; his
palet&Atilde;&acute;t&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a most characteristic
garment of no particular shape&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hung dark and
menacing; the tassel of his bonnet grec sternly shadowed his left
temple; his black whiskers curled like those of a wrathful cat; his
blue eye had a cloud in its glitter.</p>
<p id="id01109">"Ainsi," he began, abruptly fronting and arresting
me, "vous allez tr&Atilde;&acute;ner comme une reine;
demain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;tr&Atilde;&acute;ner &Atilde;&nbsp; mes
c&Atilde;&acute;t&Atilde;&copy;s? Sans doute vous savourez d'avance
les d&Atilde;&copy;lices de l'autorit&Atilde;&copy;. Je crois voir
en je ne sais quoi de rayonnante, petite ambitieuse!"</p>
<p id="id01110">Now the fact was, he happened to be entirely
mistaken. I did not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;could
not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;estimate the admiration or the good opinion
of tomorrow's audience at the same rate he did. Had that audience
numbered as many personal friends and acquaintance for me as for
him, I know not how it might have been: I speak of the case as it
stood. On me school-triumphs shed but a cold lustre. I had
wondered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I wondered
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how it was that for him they seemed to shine
as with hearth-warmth and hearth-glow. <i>He</i> cared for them
perhaps too much; <i>I</i>, probably, too little. However, I had my
own fancies as well as he. I liked, for instance, to see M. Emanuel
jealous; it lit up his nature, and woke his spirit; it threw all
sorts of queer lights and shadows over his dun face, and into his
violet-azure eyes (he used to say that his black hair and blue eyes
were "une de ses beaut&Atilde;&copy;s"). There was a relish in his
anger; it was artless, earnest, quite unreasonable, but never
hypocritical. I uttered no disclaimer then of the complacency he
attributed to me; I merely asked where the English examination came
in&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether at the commencement or close of the
day?</p>
<p id="id01111">"I hesitate," said he, "whether at the very
beginning, before many persons are come, and when your aspiring
nature will not be gratified by a large audience, or quite at the
close, when everybody is tired, and only a jaded and worn-out
attention will be at your service."</p>
<p id="id01112">"Que vous &Atilde;&ordf;tes dur, Monsieur!" I said,
affecting dejection.</p>
<p id="id01113">"One ought to be 'dur' with you. You are one of
those beings who must be <i>kept down</i>. I know you! I know you!
Other people in this house see you pass, and think that a
colourless shadow has gone by. As for me, I scrutinized your face
once, and it sufficed."</p>
<p id="id01114">"You are satisfied that you understand me?"</p>
<p id="id01115">Without answering directly, he went on, "Were you
not gratified when you succeeded in that vaudeville? I watched you
and saw a passionate ardour for triumph in your physiognomy. What
fire shot into the glance! Not mere light, but flame: je me tiens
pour averti."</p>
<p id="id01116">"What feeling I had on that occasion,
Monsieur&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and pardon me, if I say, you immensely
exaggerate both its quality and quantity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was
quite abstract. I did not care for the vaudeville. I hated the part
you assigned me. I had not the slightest sympathy with the audience
below the stage. They are good people, doubtless, but do I know
them? Are they anything to me? Can I care for being brought before
their view again to-morrow? Will the examination be anything but a
task to me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a task I wish well over?"</p>
<p id="id01117">"Shall I take it out of your hands?"</p>
<p id="id01118">"With all my heart; if you do not fear
failure."</p>
<p id="id01119">"But I should fail. I only know three phrases of
English, and a few words: par exemple, de sonn, de mone, de
stares&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;est-ce bien dit? My opinion is that it
would be better to give up the thing altogether: to have no English
examination, eh?"</p>
<p id="id01120">"If Madame consents, I consent."</p>
<p id="id01121">"Heartily?"</p>
<p id="id01122">"Very heartily."</p>
<p id="id01123">He smoked his cigar in silence. He turned
suddenly.</p>
<p id="id01124">"Donnez-moi la main," said he, and the spite and
jealousy melted out of his face, and a generous kindliness shone
there instead.</p>
<p id="id01125">"Come, we will not be rivals, we will be friends,"
he pursued. "The examination shall take place, and I will choose a
good moment; and instead of vexing and hindering, as I felt
half-inclined ten minutes ago&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for I have my
malevolent moods: I always had from childhood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
will aid you sincerely. After all, you are solitary and a stranger,
and have your way to make and your bread to earn; it may be well
that you should become known. We will be friends: do you
agree?"</p>
<p id="id01126">"Out of my heart, Monsieur. I am glad of a friend.
I like that better than a triumph."</p>
<p id="id01127">"Pauvrette?" said he, and turned away and left the
alley.</p>
<p id="id01128">The examination passed over well; M. Paul was as
good as his word, and did his best to make my part easy. The next
day came the distribution of prizes; that also passed; the school
broke up; the pupils went home, and now began the long
vacation.</p>
<p id="id01129">That vacation! Shall I ever forget it? I think not.
Madame Beck went, the first day of the holidays, to join her
children at the sea-side; all the three teachers had parents or
friends with whom they took refuge; every professor quitted the
city; some went to Paris, some to Boue-Marine; M. Paul set forth on
a pilgrimage to Rome; the house was left quite empty, but for me, a
servant, and a poor deformed and imbecile pupil, a sort of
cr&Atilde;&copy;tin, whom her stepmother in a distant province
would not allow to return home.</p>
<p id="id01130">My heart almost died within me; miserable longings
strained its chords. How long were the September days! How silent,
how lifeless! How vast and void seemed the desolate premises! How
gloomy the forsaken garden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;grey now with the
dust of a town summer departed. Looking forward at the commencement
of those eight weeks, I hardly knew how I was to live to the end.
My spirits had long been gradually sinking; now that the prop of
employment was withdrawn, they went down fast. Even to look forward
was not to hope: the dumb future spoke no comfort, offered no
promise, gave no inducement to bear present evil in reliance on
future good. A sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a despairing resignation to reach betimes the
end of all things earthly. Alas! When I had full leisure to look on
life as life must be looked on by such as me, I found it but a
hopeless desert: tawny sands, with no green fields, no palm-tree,
no well in view. The hopes which are dear to youth, which bear it
up and lead it on, I knew not and dared not know. If they knocked
at my heart sometimes, an inhospitable bar to admission must be
inwardly drawn. When they turned away thus rejected, tears sad
enough sometimes flowed: but it could not be helped: I dared not
give such guests lodging. So mortally did I fear the sin and
weakness of presumption.</p>
<p id="id01131">Religious reader, you will preach to me a long
sermon about what I have just written, and so will you, moralist:
and you, stern sage: you, stoic, will frown; you, cynic, sneer;
you, epicure, laugh. Well, each and all, take it your own way. I
accept the sermon, frown, sneer, and laugh; perhaps you are all
right: and perhaps, circumstanced like me, you would have been,
like me, wrong. The first month was, indeed, a long, black, heavy
month to me.</p>
<p id="id01132">The cr&Atilde;&copy;tin did not seem unhappy. I did
my best to feed her well and keep her warm, and she only asked food
and sunshine, or when that lacked, fire. Her weak faculties
approved of inertion: her brain, her eyes, her ears, her heart
slept content; they could not wake to work, so lethargy was their
Paradise.</p>
<p id="id01133">Three weeks of that vacation were hot, fair, and
dry, but the fourth and fifth were tempestuous and wet. I do not
know why that change in the atmosphere made a cruel impression on
me, why the raging storm and beating rain crushed me with a
deadlier paralysis than I had experienced while the air had
remained serene; but so it was; and my nervous system could hardly
support what it had for many days and nights to undergo in that
huge empty house. How I used to pray to Heaven for consolation and
support! With what dread force the conviction would grasp me that
Fate was my permanent foe, never to be conciliated. I did not, in
my heart, arraign the mercy or justice of God for this; I concluded
it to be a part of his great plan that some must deeply suffer
while they live, and I thrilled in the certainty that of this
number, I was one.</p>
<p id="id01134">It was some relief when an aunt of the
cr&Atilde;&copy;tin, a kind old woman, came one day, and took away
my strange, deformed companion. The hapless creature had been at
times a heavy charge; I could not take her out beyond the garden,
and I could not leave her a minute alone: for her poor mind, like
her body, was warped: its propensity was to evil. A vague bent to
mischief, an aimless malevolence, made constant vigilance
indispensable. As she very rarely spoke, and would sit for hours
together moping and mowing, and distorting her features with
indescribable grimaces, it was more like being prisoned with some
strange tameless animal, than associating with a human being. Then
there were personal attentions to be rendered which required the
nerve of a hospital nurse; my resolution was so tried, it sometimes
fell dead-sick. These duties should not have fallen on me; a
servant, now absent, had rendered them hitherto, and in the hurry
of holiday departure, no substitute to fill this office had been
provided. This tax and trial were by no means the least I have
known in life. Still, menial and distasteful as they were, my
mental pain was far more wasting and wearing. Attendance on the
cr&Atilde;&copy;tin deprived me often of the power and inclination
to swallow a meal, and sent me faint to the fresh air, and the well
or fountain in the court; but this duty never wrung my heart, or
brimmed my eyes, or scalded my cheek with tears hot as molten
metal.</p>
<p id="id01135">The cr&Atilde;&copy;tin being gone, I was free to
walk out. At first I lacked courage to venture very far from the
Rue Fossette, but by degrees I sought the city gates, and passed
them, and then went wandering away far along
chauss&Atilde;&copy;es, through fields, beyond cemeteries, Catholic
and Protestant, beyond farmsteads, to lanes and little woods, and I
know not where. A goad thrust me on, a fever forbade me to rest; a
want of companionship maintained in my soul the cravings of a most
deadly famine. I often walked all day, through the burning noon and
the arid afternoon, and the dusk evening, and came back with
moonrise.</p>
<p id="id01136">While wandering in solitude, I would sometimes
picture the present probable position of others, my acquaintance.
There was Madame Beck at a cheerful watering-place with her
children, her mother, and a whole troop of friends who had sought
the same scene of relaxation. Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St. Pierre was at
Paris, with her relatives; the other teachers were at their homes.
There was Ginevra Fanshawe, whom certain of her connections had
carried on a pleasant tour southward. Ginevra seemed to me the
happiest. She was on the route of beautiful scenery; these
September suns shone for her on fertile plains, where harvest and
vintage matured under their mellow beam. These gold and crystal
moons rose on her vision over blue horizons waved in mounted
lines.</p>
<p id="id01137">But all this was nothing; I too felt those autumn
suns and saw those harvest moons, and I almost wished to be covered
in with earth and turf, deep out of their influence; for I could
not live in their light, nor make them comrades, nor yield them
affection. But Ginevra had a kind of spirit with her, empowered to
give constant strength and comfort, to gladden daylight and embalm
darkness; the best of the good genii that guard humanity curtained
her with his wings, and canopied her head with his bending form. By
True Love was Ginevra followed: never could she be alone. Was she
insensible to this presence? It seemed to me impossible: I could
not realize such deadness. I imagined her grateful in secret,
loving now with reserve; but purposing one day to show how much she
loved: I pictured her faithful hero half conscious of her coy
fondness, and comforted by that consciousness: I conceived an
electric chord of sympathy between them, a fine chain of mutual
understanding, sustaining union through a separation of a hundred
leagues&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;carrying, across mound and hollow,
communication by prayer and wish. Ginevra gradually became with me
a sort of heroine. One day, perceiving this growing illusion, I
said, "I really believe my nerves are getting overstretched: my
mind has suffered somewhat too much a malady is growing upon
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what shall I do? How shall I keep well?"</p>
<p id="id01138">Indeed there was no way to keep well under the
circumstances. At last a day and night of peculiarly agonizing
depression were succeeded by physical illness, I took perforce to
my bed. About this time the Indian summer closed and the
equinoctial storms began; and for nine dark and wet days, of which
the hours rushed on all turbulent, deaf,
dishevelled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bewildered with sounding
hurricane&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I lay in a strange fever of the nerves
and blood. Sleep went quite away. I used to rise in the night, look
round for her, beseech her earnestly to return. A rattle of the
window, a cry of the blast only replied&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;-Sleep
never came!</p>
<p id="id01139">I err. She came once, but in anger. Impatient of my
importunity she brought with her an avenging dream. By the clock of
St. Jean Baptiste, that dream remained scarce fifteen
minutes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a brief space, but sufficing to wring my
whole frame with unknown anguish; to confer a nameless experience
that had the hue, the mien, the terror, the very tone of a
visitation from eternity. Between twelve and one that night a cup
was forced to my lips, black, strong, strange, drawn from no well,
but filled up seething from a bottomless and boundless sea.
Suffering, brewed in temporal or calculable measure, and mixed for
mortal lips, tastes not as this suffering tasted. Having drank and
woke, I thought all was over: the end come and past by. Trembling
fearfully&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as consciousness
returned&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ready to cry out on some
fellow-creature to help me, only that I knew no fellow-creature was
near enough to catch the wild summons&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Goton in
her far distant attic could not hear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I rose on
my knees in bed. Some fearful hours went over me: indescribably was
I torn, racked and oppressed in mind. Amidst the horrors of that
dream I think the worst lay here. Methought the well-loved dead,
who had loved <i>me</i> well in life, met me elsewhere, alienated:
galled was my inmost spirit with an unutterable sense of despair
about the future. Motive there was none why I should try to recover
or wish to live; and yet quite unendurable was the pitiless and
haughty voice in which Death challenged me to engage his unknown
terrors. When I tried to pray I could only utter these words: "From
my youth up Thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind."</p>
<p id="id01140">Most true was it.</p>
<p id="id01141">On bringing me my tea next morning Goton urged me
to call in a doctor.<br />
I would not: I thought no doctor could cure me.<br /></p>
<p id="id01142">One evening&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I was not
delirious: I was in my sane mind, I got up&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
dressed myself, weak and shaking. The solitude and the stillness of
the long dormitory could not be borne any longer; the ghastly white
beds were turning into spectres&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the coronal of
each became a death's-head, huge and
sun-bleached&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dead dreams of an elder world and
mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping eyeholes. That
evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the conviction
that Fate was of stone, and Hope a false
idol&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;blind, bloodless, and of granite core. I
felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining its
climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble,
trembling as they were. It rained still, and blew; but with more
clemency, I thought, than it had poured and raged all day. Twilight
was falling, and I deemed its influence pitiful; from the lattice I
saw coming night-clouds trailing low like banners drooping. It
seemed to me that at this hour there was affection and sorrow in
Heaven above for all pain suffered on earth beneath; the weight of
my dreadful dream became alleviated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
insufferable thought of being no more loved&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no
more owned, half-yielded to hope of the
contrary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I was sure this hope would shine
clearer if I got out from under this house-roof, which was crushing
as the slab of a tomb, and went outside the city to a certain quiet
hill, a long way distant in the fields. Covered with a cloak (I
could not be delirious, for I had sense and recollection to put on
warm clothing), forth I set. The bells of a church arrested me in
passing; they seemed to call me in to the <i>salut</i>, and I went
in. Any solemn rite, any spectacle of sincere worship, any opening
for appeal to God was as welcome to me then as bread to one in
extremity of want. I knelt down with others on the stone pavement.
It was an old solemn church, its pervading gloom not gilded but
purpled by light shed through stained glass.</p>
<p id="id01143">Few worshippers were assembled, and, the
<i>salut</i> over, half of them departed. I discovered soon that
those left remained to confess. I did not stir. Carefully every
door of the church was shut; a holy quiet sank upon, and a solemn
shade gathered about us. After a space, breathless and spent in
prayer, a penitent approached the confessional. I watched. She
whispered her avowal; her shrift was whispered back; she returned
consoled. Another went, and another. A pale lady, kneeling near me,
said in a low, kind voice:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Go you now, I am not
quite prepared."</p>
<p id="id01144">Mechanically obedient, I rose and went. I knew what
I was about; my mind had run over the intent with lightning-speed.
To take this step could not make me more wretched than I was; it
might soothe me.</p>
<p id="id01145">The priest within the confessional never turned his
eyes to regard me; he only quietly inclined his ear to my lips. He
might be a good man, but this duty had become to him a sort of
form: he went through it with the phlegm of custom. I hesitated; of
the formula of confession I was ignorant: instead of commencing,
then, with the prelude usual, I said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Mon
p&Atilde;&uml;re, je suis Protestante."</p>
<p id="id01146">He directly turned. He was not a native priest: of
that class, the cast of physiognomy is, almost invariably,
grovelling: I saw by his profile and brow he was a Frenchman;
though grey and advanced in years, he did not, I think, lack
feeling or intelligence. He inquired, not unkindly, why, being a
Protestant, I came to him?</p>
<p id="id01147">I said I was perishing for a word of advice or an
accent of comfort. I had been living for some weeks quite alone; I
had been ill; I had a pressure of affliction on my mind of which it
would hardly any longer endure the weight.</p>
<p id="id01148">"Was it a sin, a crime?" he inquired, somewhat
startled. I reassured him on this point, and, as well as I could, I
showed him the mere outline of my experience.</p>
<p id="id01149">He looked thoughtful, surprised, puzzled. "You take
me unawares," said he. "I have not had such a case as yours before:
ordinarily we know our routine, and are prepared; but this makes a
great break in the common course of confession. I am hardly
furnished with counsel fitting the circumstances."</p>
<p id="id01150">Of course, I had not expected he would be; but the
mere relief of communication in an ear which was human and
sentient, yet consecrated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the mere pouring out
of some portion of long accumulating, long pent-up pain into a
vessel whence it could not be again diffused&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had
done me good. I was already solaced.</p>
<p id="id01151">"Must I go, father?" I asked of him as he sat
silent.</p>
<p id="id01152">"My daughter," he said
kindly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I am sure he was a kind man: he had a
compassionate eye&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"for the present you had
better go: but I assure you your words have struck me. Confession,
like other things, is apt to become formal and trivial with habit.
You have come and poured your heart out; a thing seldom done. I
would fain think your case over, and take it with me to my oratory.
Were you of our faith I should know what to
say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a mind so tossed can find repose but in the
bosom of retreat, and the punctual practice of piety. The world, it
is well known, has no satisfaction for that class of natures. Holy
men have bidden penitents like you to hasten their path upward by
penance, self-denial, and difficult good works. Tears are given
them here for meat and drink&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bread of affliction
and waters of affliction&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;their recompence comes
hereafter. It is my own conviction that these impressions under
which you are smarting are messengers from God to bring you back to
the true Church. You were made for our faith: depend upon it our
faith alone could heal and help
you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Protestantism is altogether too dry, cold,
prosaic for you. The further I look into this matter, the more
plainly I see it is entirely out of the common order of things. On
no account would I lose sight of you. Go, my daughter, for the
present; but return to me again."</p>
<p id="id01153">I rose and thanked him. I was withdrawing when he
signed me to return.</p>
<p id="id01154">"You must not come to this church," said he: "I see
you are ill, and this church is too cold; you must come to my
house: I live&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;" (and he gave
me his address). "Be there to-morrow morning at ten."</p>
<p id="id01155">In reply to this appointment, I only bowed; and
pulling down my veil, and gathering round me my cloak, I glided
away.</p>
<p id="id01156">Did I, do you suppose, reader, contemplate
venturing again within that worthy priest's reach? As soon should I
have thought of walking into a Babylonish furnace. That priest had
arms which could influence me: he was naturally kind, with a
sentimental French kindness, to whose softness I knew myself not
wholly impervious. Without respecting some sorts of affection,
there was hardly any sort having a fibre of root in reality, which
I could rely on my force wholly to withstand. Had I gone to him, he
would have shown me all that was tender, and comforting, and
gentle, in the honest Popish superstition. Then he would have tried
to kindle, blow and stir up in me the zeal of good works. I know
not how it would all have ended. We all think ourselves strong in
some points; we all know ourselves weak in many; the probabilities
are that had I visited Numero 10, Rue des Mages, at the hour and
day appointed, I might just now, instead of writing this heretic
narrative, be counting my beads in the cell of a certain Carmelite
convent on the Boulevard of Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy, in Villette. There
was something of F&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;lon about that
benign old priest; and whatever most of his brethren may be, and
whatever I may think of his Church and creed (and I like neither),
of himself I must ever retain a grateful recollection. He was kind
when I needed kindness; he did me good. May Heaven bless him!</p>
<p id="id01157">Twilight had passed into night, and the lamps were
lit in the streets ere I issued from that sombre church. To turn
back was now become possible to me; the wild longing to breathe
this October wind on the little hill far without the city walls had
ceased to be an imperative impulse, and was softened into a wish
with which Reason could cope: she put it down, and I turned, as I
thought, to the Rue Fossette. But I had become involved in a part
of the city with which I was not familiar; it was the old part, and
full of narrow streets of picturesque, ancient, and mouldering
houses. I was much too weak to be very collected, and I was still
too careless of my own welfare and safety to be cautious; I grew
embarrassed; I got immeshed in a network of turns unknown. I was
lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger.</p>
<p id="id01158">If the storm had lulled a little at sunset, it made
up now for lost time. Strong and horizontal thundered the current
of the wind from north-west to south-east; it brought rain like
spray, and sometimes a sharp hail, like shot: it was cold and
pierced me to the vitals. I bent my head to meet it, but it beat me
back. My heart did not fail at all in this conflict; I only wished
that I had wings and could ascend the gale, spread and repose my
pinions on its strength, career in its course, sweep where it
swept. While wishing this, I suddenly felt colder where before I
was cold, and more powerless where before I was weak. I tried to
reach the porch of a great building near, but the mass of frontage
and the giant spire turned black and vanished from my eyes. Instead
of sinking on the steps as I intended, I seemed to pitch headlong
down an abyss. I remember no more.</p>
<h2 id="id01159" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h5 id="id01160">AULD LANG SYNE.</h5>
<p id="id01161" style="margin-top: 2em">Where my soul went during
that swoon I cannot tell. Whatever she saw, or wherever she
travelled in her trance on that strange night she kept her own
secret; never whispering a word to Memory, and baffling imagination
by an indissoluble silence. She may have gone upward, and come in
sight of her eternal home, hoping for leave to rest now, and
deeming that her painful union with matter was at last dissolved.
While she so deemed, an angel may have warned her away from
heaven's threshold, and, guiding her weeping down, have bound her,
once more, all shuddering and unwilling, to that poor frame, cold
and wasted, of whose companionship she was grown more than
weary.</p>
<p id="id01162">I know she re-entered her prison with pain, with
reluctance, with a moan and a long shiver. The divorced mates,
Spirit and Substance, were hard to re-unite: they greeted each
other, not in an embrace, but a racking sort of struggle. The
returning sense of sight came upon me, red, as if it swam in blood;
suspended hearing rushed back loud, like thunder; consciousness
revived in fear: I sat up appalled, wondering into what region,
amongst what strange beings I was waking. At first I knew nothing I
looked on: a wall was not a wall&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a lamp not a
lamp. I should have understood what we call a ghost, as well as I
did the commonest object: which is another way of intimating that
all my eye rested on struck it as spectral. But the faculties soon
settled each in his place; the life-machine presently resumed its
wonted and regular working.</p>
<p id="id01163">Still, I knew not where I was; only in time I saw I
had been removed from the spot where I fell: I lay on no
portico-step; night and tempest were excluded by walls, windows,
and ceiling. Into some house I had been
carried&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but what house?</p>
<p id="id01164">I could only think of the pensionnat in the Rue
Fossette. Still half-dreaming, I tried hard to discover in what
room they had put me; whether the great dormitory, or one of the
little dormitories. I was puzzled, because I could not make the
glimpses of furniture I saw accord with my knowledge of any of
these apartments. The empty white beds were wanting, and the long
line of large windows. "Surely," thought I, "it is not to Madame
Beck's own chamber they have carried me!" And here my eye fell on
an easy-chair covered with blue damask. Other seats, cushioned to
match, dawned on me by degrees; and at last I took in the complete
fact of a pleasant parlour, with a wood fire on a clear-shining
hearth, a carpet where arabesques of bright blue relieved a ground
of shaded fawn; pale walls over which a slight but endless garland
of azure forget-me-nots ran mazed and bewildered amongst myriad
gold leaves and tendrils. A gilded mirror filled up the space
between two windows, curtained amply with blue damask. In this
mirror I saw myself laid, not in bed, but on a sofa. I looked
spectral; my eyes larger and more hollow, my hair darker than was
natural, by contrast with my thin and ashen face. It was obvious,
not only from the furniture, but from the position of windows,
doors, and fireplace, that this was an unknown room in an unknown
house.</p>
<p id="id01165">Hardly less plain was it that my brain was not yet
settled; for, as I gazed at the blue arm-chair, it appeared to grow
familiar; so did a certain scroll-couch, and not less so the round
centre-table, with a blue-covering, bordered with autumn-tinted
foliage; and, above all, two little footstools with worked covers,
and a small ebony-framed chair, of which the seat and back were
also worked with groups of brilliant flowers on a dark ground.</p>
<p id="id01166">Struck with these things, I explored further.
Strange to say, old acquaintance were all about me, and "auld lang
syne" smiled out of every nook. There were two oval miniatures over
the mantel-piece, of which I knew by heart the pearls about the
high and powdered "heads;" the velvets circling the white throats;
the swell of the full muslin kerchiefs: the pattern of the lace
sleeve-ruffles. Upon the mantel-shelf there were two china vases,
some relics of a diminutive tea-service, as smooth as enamel and as
thin as egg-shell, and a white centre ornament, a classic group in
alabaster, preserved under glass. Of all these things I could have
told the peculiarities, numbered the flaws or cracks, like any
<i>clairvoyante</i>. Above all, there was a pair of handscreens,
with elaborate pencil-drawings finished like line engravings;
these, my very eyes ached at beholding again, recalling hours when
they had followed, stroke by stroke and touch by touch, a tedious,
feeble, finical, school-girl pencil held in these fingers, now so
skeleton-like.</p>
<p id="id01167">Where was I? Not only in what spot of the world,
but in what year of our Lord? For all these objects were of past
days, and of a distant country. Ten years ago I bade them good-by;
since my fourteenth year they and I had never met. I gasped
audibly, "Where am I?"</p>
<p id="id01168">A shape hitherto unnoticed, stirred, rose, came
forward: a shape inharmonious with the environment, serving only to
complicate the riddle further. This was no more than a sort of
native bonne, in a common-place bonne's cap and print-dress. She
spoke neither French nor English, and I could get no intelligence
from her, not understanding her phrases of dialect. But she bathed
my temples and forehead with some cool and perfumed water, and then
she heightened the cushion on which I reclined, made signs that I
was not to speak, and resumed her post at the foot of the sofa.</p>
<p id="id01169">She was busy knitting; her eyes thus drawn from me,
I could gaze on her without interruption. I did mightily wonder how
she came there, or what she could have to do among the scenes, or
with the days of my girlhood. Still more I marvelled what those
scenes and days could now have to do with me.</p>
<p id="id01170">Too weak to scrutinize thoroughly the mystery, I
tried to settle it by saying it was a mistake, a dream, a
fever-fit; and yet I knew there could be no mistake, and that I was
not sleeping, and I believed I was sane. I wished the room had not
been so well lighted, that I might not so clearly have seen the
little pictures, the ornaments, the screens, the worked chair. All
these objects, as well as the blue-damask furniture, were, in fact,
precisely the same, in every minutest detail, with those I so well
remembered, and with which I had been so thoroughly intimate, in
the drawing-room of my godmother's house at Bretton. Methought the
apartment only was changed, being of different proportions and
dimensions.</p>
<p id="id01171">I thought of Bedreddin Hassan, transported in his
sleep from Cairo to the gates of Damascus. Had a Genius stooped his
dark wing down the storm to whose stress I had succumbed, and
gathering me from the church-steps, and "rising high into the air,"
as the eastern tale said, had he borne me over land and ocean, and
laid me quietly down beside a hearth of Old England? But no; I knew
the fire of that hearth burned before its Lares no
more&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it went out long ago, and the household
gods had been carried elsewhere.</p>
<p id="id01172">The bonne turned again to survey me, and seeing my
eyes wide open, and, I suppose, deeming their expression perturbed
and excited, she put down her knitting. I saw her busied for a
moment at a little stand; she poured out water, and measured drops
from a phial: glass in hand, she approached me. What dark-tinged
draught might she now be offering? what Genii-elixir or
Magi-distillation?</p>
<p id="id01173">It was too late to inquire&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I had
swallowed it passively, and at once. A tide of quiet thought now
came gently caressing my brain; softer and softer rose the flow,
with tepid undulations smoother than balm. The pain of weakness
left my limbs, my muscles slept. I lost power to move; but, losing
at the same time wish, it was no privation. That kind bonne placed
a screen between me and the lamp; I saw her rise to do this, but do
not remember seeing her resume her place: in the interval between
the two acts, I "fell on sleep."</p>
<p id="id01174">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id01175">At waking, lo! all was again changed. The light of
high day surrounded me; not, indeed, a warm, summer light, but the
leaden gloom of raw and blustering autumn. I felt sure now that I
was in the pensionnat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sure by the beating rain
on the casement; sure by the "wuther" of wind amongst trees,
denoting a garden outside; sure by the chill, the whiteness, the
solitude, amidst which I lay. I say
<i>whiteness</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for the dimity curtains,
dropped before a French bed, bounded my view.</p>
<p id="id01176">I lifted them; I looked out. My eye, prepared to
take in the range of a long, large, and whitewashed chamber,
blinked baffled, on encountering the limited area of a small
cabinet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a cabinet with seagreen walls; also,
instead of five wide and naked windows, there was one high lattice,
shaded with muslin festoons: instead of two dozen little stands of
painted wood, each holding a basin and an ewer, there was a
toilette-table dressed, like a lady for a ball, in a white robe
over a pink skirt; a polished and large glass crowned, and a pretty
pin-cushion frilled with lace, adorned it. This toilette, together
with a small, low, green and white chintz arm-chair, a washstand
topped with a marble slab, and supplied with utensils of pale
greenware, sufficiently furnished the tiny chamber.</p>
<p id="id01177">Reader; I felt alarmed! Why? you will ask. What was
there in this simple and somewhat pretty sleeping-closet to startle
the most timid? Merely this&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;These articles of
furniture could not be real, solid arm-chairs, looking-glasses, and
washstands&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;they must be the ghosts of such
articles; or, if this were denied as too wild an
hypothesis&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and, confounded as I was, I
<i>did</i> deny it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there remained but to
conclude that I had myself passed into an abnormal state of mind;
in short, that I was very ill and delirious: and even then, mine
was the strangest figment with which delirium had ever harassed a
victim.</p>
<p id="id01178">I knew&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I was obliged to
know&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the green chintz of that little chair; the
little snug chair itself, the carved, shining-black, foliated frame
of that glass; the smooth, milky-green of the china vessels on the
stand; the very stand too, with its top of grey marble, splintered
at one corner;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all these I was compelled to
recognise and to hail, as last night I had, perforce, recognised
and hailed the rosewood, the drapery, the porcelain, of the
drawing-room.</p>
<p id="id01179">Bretton! Bretton! and ten years ago shone reflected
in that mirror. And why did Bretton and my fourteenth year haunt me
thus? Why, if they came at all, did they not return complete? Why
hovered before my distempered vision the mere furniture, while the
rooms and the locality were gone? As to that pincushion made of
crimson satin, ornamented with gold beads and frilled with
thread-lace, I had the same right to know it as to know the
screens&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I had made it myself. Rising with a
start from the bed, I took the cushion in my hand and examined it.
There was the cipher "L. L. B." formed in gold beds, and surrounded
with an oval wreath embroidered in white silk. These were the
initials of my godmother's name&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Lonisa Lucy
Bretton.</p>
<p id="id01180">"Am I in England? Am I at Bretton?" I muttered; and
hastily pulling up the blind with which the lattice was shrouded, I
looked out to try and discover <i>where</i> I was; half-prepared to
meet the calm, old, handsome buildings and clean grey pavement of
St. Ann's Street, and to see at the end the towers of the minster:
or, if otherwise, fully expectant of a town view somewhere, a rue
in Villette, if not a street in a pleasant and ancient English
city.</p>
<p id="id01181">I looked, on the contrary, through a frame of
leafage, clustering round the high lattice, and forth thence to a
grassy mead-like level, a lawn-terrace with trees rising from the
lower ground beyond&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;high forest-trees, such as I
had not seen for many a day. They were now groaning under the gale
of October, and between their trunks I traced the line of an
avenue, where yellow leaves lay in heaps and drifts, or were
whirled singly before the sweeping west wind. Whatever landscape
might lie further must have been flat, and these tall beeches shut
it out. The place seemed secluded, and was to me quite strange: I
did not know it at all.</p>
<p id="id01182">Once more I lay down. My bed stood in a little
alcove; on turning my face to the wall, the room with its
bewildering accompaniments became excluded. Excluded? No! For as I
arranged my position in this hope, behold, on the green space
between the divided and looped-up curtains, hung a broad, gilded
picture-frame enclosing a portrait. It was
drawn&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;well drawn, though but a
sketch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in water-colours; a head, a boy's head,
fresh, life-like, speaking, and animated. It seemed a youth of
sixteen, fair-complexioned, with sanguine health in his cheek; hair
long, not dark, and with a sunny sheen; penetrating eyes, an arch
mouth, and a gay smile. On the whole a most pleasant face to look
at, especially for, those claiming a right to that youth's
affections&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;parents, for instance, or sisters.
Any romantic little school-girl might almost have loved it in its
frame. Those eyes looked as if when somewhat older they would flash
a lightning-response to love: I cannot tell whether they kept in
store the steady-beaming shine of faith. For whatever sentiment met
him in form too facile, his lips menaced, beautifully but surely,
caprice and light esteem.</p>
<p id="id01183">Striving to take each new discovery as quietly as I
could, I whispered to myself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id01184">"Ah! that portrait used to hang in the
breakfast-room, over the mantel-piece: somewhat too high, as I
thought. I well remember how I used to mount a music-stool for the
purpose of unhooking it, holding it in my hand, and searching into
those bonny wells of eyes, whose glance under their hazel lashes
seemed like a pencilled laugh; and well I liked to note the
colouring of the cheek, and the expression of the mouth." I hardly
believed fancy could improve on the curve of that mouth, or of the
chin; even <i>my</i> ignorance knew that both were beautiful, and
pondered perplexed over this doubt: "How it was that what charmed
so much, could at the same time so keenly pain?" Once, by way of
test, I took little Missy Home, and, lifting her in my arms, told
her to look at the picture.</p>
<p id="id01185">"Do you like it, Polly?" I asked. She never
answered, but gazed long, and at last a darkness went trembling
through her sensitive eye, as she said, "Put me down." So I put her
down, saying to myself: "The child feels it too."</p>
<p id="id01186">All these things do I now think over, adding, "He
had his faults, yet scarce ever was a finer nature; liberal, suave,
impressible." My reflections closed in an audibly pronounced word,
"Graham!"</p>
<p id="id01187">"Graham!" echoed a sudden voice at the bedside. "Do
you want Graham?"</p>
<p id="id01188">I looked. The plot was but thickening; the wonder
but culminating. If it was strange to see that well-remembered
pictured form on the wall, still stranger was it to turn and behold
the equally well-remembered living form
opposite&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a woman, a lady, most real and
substantial, tall, well-attired, wearing widow's silk, and such a
cap as best became her matron and motherly braids of hair. Hers,
too, was a good face; too marked, perhaps, now for beauty, but not
for sense or character. She was little changed; something sterner,
something more robust&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but she was my godmother:
still the distinct vision of Mrs. Bretton.</p>
<p id="id01189">I kept quiet, yet internally <i>I</i> was much
agitated: my pulse fluttered, and the blood left my cheek, which
turned cold.</p>
<p id="id01190">"Madam, where am I?" I inquired.</p>
<p id="id01191">"In a very safe asylum; well protected for the
present; make your mind quite easy till you get a little better;
you look ill this morning."</p>
<p id="id01192">"I am so entirely bewildered, I do not know whether
I can trust my senses at all, or whether they are misleading me in
every particular: but you speak English, do you not, madam?"</p>
<p id="id01193">"I should think you might hear that: it would
puzzle me to hold a long discourse in French."</p>
<p id="id01194">"You do not come from England?"</p>
<p id="id01195">"I am lately arrived thence. Have you been long in
this country? You seem to know my son?"</p>
<p id="id01196">"Do, I, madam? Perhaps I do. Your
son&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the picture there?"</p>
<p id="id01197">"That is his portrait as a youth. While looking at
it, you pronounced his name."</p>
<p id="id01198">"Graham Bretton?"</p>
<p id="id01199">She nodded.</p>
<p id="id01200">"I speak to Mrs. Bretton, formerly of Bretton,
&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shire?"</p>
<p id="id01201">"Quite right; and you, I am told, are an English
teacher in a foreign school here: my son recognised you as
such."</p>
<p id="id01202">"How was I found, madam, and by whom?"</p>
<p id="id01203">"My son shall tell you that by-and-by," said she;
"but at present you are too confused and weak for conversation: try
to eat some breakfast, and then sleep."</p>
<p id="id01204">Notwithstanding all I had
undergone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the bodily fatigue, the perturbation
of spirits, the exposure to weather&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it seemed
that I was better: the fever, the real malady which had oppressed
my frame, was abating; for, whereas during the last nine days I had
taken no solid food, and suffered from continual thirst, this
morning, on breakfast being offered, I experienced a craving for
nourishment: an inward faintness which caused me eagerly to taste
the tea this lady offered, and to eat the morsel of dry toast she
allowed in accompaniment. It was only a morsel, but it sufficed;
keeping up my strength till some two or three hours afterwards,
when the bonne brought me a little cup of broth and a biscuit.</p>
<p id="id01205">As evening began to darken, and the ceaseless blast
still blew wild and cold, and the rain streamed on, deluge-like, I
grew weary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;very weary of my bed. The room,
though pretty, was small: I felt it confining: I longed for a
change. The increasing chill and gathering gloom, too, depressed
me; I wanted to see&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to feel firelight. Besides,
I kept thinking of the son of that tall matron: when should I see
him? Certainly not till I left my room.</p>
<p id="id01206">At last the bonne came to make my bed for the
night. She prepared to wrap me in a blanket and place me in the
little chintz chair; but, declining these attentions, I proceeded
to dress myself:</p>
<p id="id01207">The business was just achieved, and I was sitting
down to take breath, when Mrs. Bretton once more appeared.</p>
<p id="id01208">"Dressed!" she exclaimed, smiling with that smile I
so well knew&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a pleasant smile, though not soft.
"You are quite better then? Quite
strong&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;eh?"</p>
<p id="id01209">She spoke to me so much as of old she used to speak
that I almost fancied she was beginning to know me. There was the
same sort of patronage in her voice and manner that, as a girl, I
had always experienced from her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a patronage I
yielded to and even liked; it was not founded on conventional
grounds of superior wealth or station (in the last particular there
had never been any inequality; her degree was mine); but on natural
reasons of physical advantage: it was the shelter the tree gives
the herb. I put a request without further ceremony.</p>
<p id="id01210">"Do let me go down-stairs, madam; I am so cold and
dull here."</p>
<p id="id01211">"I desire nothing better, if you are strong enough
to bear the change," was her reply. "Come then; here is an arm."
And she offered me hers: I took it, and we descended one flight of
carpeted steps to a landing where a tall door, standing open, gave
admission into the blue-damask room. How pleasant it was in its air
of perfect domestic comfort! How warm in its amber lamp-light and
vermilion fire-flush! To render the picture perfect, tea stood
ready on the table&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an English tea, whereof the
whole shining service glanced at me familiarly; from the solid
silver urn, of antique pattern, and the massive pot of the same
metal, to the thin porcelain cups, dark with purple and gilding. I
knew the very seed-cake of peculiar form, baked in a peculiar
mould, which always had a place on the tea-table at Bretton. Graham
liked it, and there it was as of yore&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;set before
Graham's plate with the silver knife and fork beside it. Graham was
then expected to tea: Graham was now, perhaps, in the house; ere
many minutes I might see him.</p>
<p id="id01212">"Sit down&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sit down," said my
conductress, as my step faltered a little in passing to the hearth.
She seated me on the sofa, but I soon passed behind it, saying the
fire was too hot; in its shade I found another seat which suited me
better. Mrs. Bretton was never wont to make a fuss about any person
or anything; without remonstrance she suffered me to have my own
way. She made the tea, and she took up the newspaper. I liked to
watch every action of my godmother; all her movements were so
young: she must have been now above fifty, yet neither her sinews
nor her spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age. Though
portly, she was alert, and though serene, she was at times
impetuous&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;good health and an excellent
temperament kept her green as in her spring.</p>
<p id="id01213">While she read, I perceived she
listened&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;listened for her son. She was not the
woman ever to confess herself uneasy, but there was yet no lull in
the weather, and if Graham were out in that hoarse
wind&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;roaring still
unsatisfied&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I well knew his mother's heart would
be out with him.</p>
<p id="id01214">"Ten minutes behind his time," said she, looking at
her watch; then, in another minute, a lifting of her eyes from the
page, and a slight inclination of her head towards the door,
denoted that she heard some sound. Presently her brow cleared; and
then even my ear, less practised, caught the iron clash of a gate
swung to, steps on gravel, lastly the door-bell. He was come. His
mother filled the teapot from the urn, she drew nearer the hearth
the stuffed and cushioned blue chair&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her own
chair by right, but I saw there was one who might with impunity
usurp it. And when that <i>one</i> came up the
stairs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which he soon did, after, I suppose, some
such attention to the toilet as the wild and wet night rendered
necessary, and strode straight in&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id01215">"Is it you, Graham?" said his mother, hiding a glad
smile and speaking curtly.</p>
<p id="id01216">"Who else should it be, mamma?" demanded the
Unpunctual, possessing himself irreverently of the abdicated
throne.</p>
<p id="id01217">"Don't you deserve cold tea, for being late?"</p>
<p id="id01218">"I shall not get my deserts, for the urn sings
cheerily."</p>
<p id="id01219">"Wheel yourself to the table, lazy boy: no seat
will serve you but mine; if you had one spark of a sense of
propriety, you would always leave that chair for the Old Lady."</p>
<p id="id01220">"So I should; only the dear Old Lady persists in
leaving it for me. How is your patient, mamma?"</p>
<p id="id01221">"Will she come forward and speak for herself?" said
Mrs. Bretton, turning to my corner; and at this invitation, forward
I came. Graham courteously rose up to greet me. He stood tall on
the hearth, a figure justifying his mother's unconcealed pride.</p>
<p id="id01222">"So you are come down," said he; "you must be
better then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;much better. I scarcely expected we
should meet thus, or here. I was alarmed last night, and if I had
not been forced to hurry away to a dying patient, I certainly would
not have left you; but my mother herself is something of a
doctress, and Martha an excellent nurse. I saw the case was a
fainting-fit, not necessarily dangerous. What brought it on, I have
yet to learn, and all particulars; meantime, I trust you really do
feel better?"</p>
<p id="id01223">"Much better," I said calmly. "Much better, I thank
you, Dr. John."</p>
<p id="id01224">For, reader, this tall young
man&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this darling son&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this
host of mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this Graham Bretton, <i>was</i> Dr.
John: he, and no other; and, what is more, I ascertained this
identity scarcely with surprise. What is more, when I heard
Graham's step on the stairs, I knew what manner of figure would
enter, and for whose aspect to prepare my eyes. The discovery was
not of to-day, its dawn had penetrated my perceptions long since.
Of course I remembered young Bretton well; and though ten years
(from sixteen to twenty-six) may greatly change the boy as they
mature him to the man, yet they could bring no such utter
difference as would suffice wholly to blind my eyes, or baffle my
memory. Dr. John Graham Bretton retained still an affinity to the
youth of sixteen: he had his eyes; he had some of his features; to
wit, all the excellently-moulded lower half of the face; I found
him out soon. I first recognised him on that occasion, noted
several chapters back, when my unguardedly-fixed attention had
drawn on me the mortification of an implied rebuke. Subsequent
observation confirmed, in every point, that early surmise. I traced
in the gesture, the port, and the habits of his manhood, all his
boy's promise. I heard in his now deep tones the accent of former
days. Certain turns of phrase, peculiar to him of old, were
peculiar to him still; and so was many a trick of eye and lip, many
a smile, many a sudden ray levelled from the irid, under his
well-charactered brow.</p>
<p id="id01225">To <i>say</i> anything on the subject, to
<i>hint</i> at my discovery, had not suited my habits of thought,
or assimilated with my system of feeling. On the contrary, I had
preferred to keep the matter to myself. I liked entering his
presence covered with a cloud he had not seen through, while he
stood before me under a ray of special illumination which shone all
partial over his head, trembled about his feet, and cast light no
farther.</p>
<p id="id01226">Well I knew that to him it could make little
difference, were I to come forward and announce, "This is Lucy
Snowe!" So I kept back in my teacher's place; and as he never asked
my name, so I never gave it. He heard me called "Miss," and "Miss
Lucy;" he never heard the surname, "Snowe." As to spontaneous
recognition&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though I, perhaps, was still less
changed than he&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the idea never approached his
mind, and why should I suggest it?</p>
<p id="id01227">During tea, Dr. John was kind, as it was his nature
to be; that meal over, and the tray carried out, he made a cosy
arrangement of the cushions in a corner of the sofa, and obliged me
to settle amongst them. He and his mother also drew to the fire,
and ere we had sat ten minutes, I caught the eye of the latter
fastened steadily upon me. Women are certainly quicker in some
things than men.</p>
<p id="id01228">"Well," she exclaimed, presently, "I have seldom
seen a stronger likeness! Graham, have you observed it?"</p>
<p id="id01229">"Observed what? What ails the Old Lady now? How you
stare, mamma! One would think you had an attack of second
sight."</p>
<p id="id01230">"Tell me, Graham, of whom does that young lady
remind you?" pointing to me.</p>
<p id="id01231">"Mamma, you put her out of countenance. I often
tell you abruptness is your fault; remember, too, that to you she
is a stranger, and does not know your ways."</p>
<p id="id01232">"Now, when she looks down; now, when she turns
sideways, who is she like, Graham?"</p>
<p id="id01233">"Indeed, mamma, since you propound the riddle, I
think you ought to solve it!"</p>
<p id="id01234">"And you have known her some time, you
say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ever since you first began to attend the
school in the Rue Fossette:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;yet you never
mentioned to me that singular resemblance!"</p>
<p id="id01235">"I could not mention a thing of which I never
thought, and which I do not now acknowledge. What <i>can</i> you
mean?"</p>
<p id="id01236">"Stupid boy! look at her."</p>
<p id="id01237">Graham did look: but this was not to be endured; I
saw how it must end, so I thought it best to anticipate.</p>
<p id="id01238">"Dr. John," I said, "has had so much to do and
think of, since he and I shook hands at our last parting in St.
Ann's Street, that, while I readily found out Mr. Graham Bretton,
some months ago, it never occurred to me as possible that he should
recognise Lucy Snowe."</p>
<p id="id01239">"Lucy Snowe! I thought so! I knew it!" cried Mrs.
Bretton. And she at once stepped across the hearth and kissed me.
Some ladies would, perhaps, have made a great bustle upon such a
discovery without being particularly glad of it; but it was not my
godmother's habit to make a bustle, and she preferred all
sentimental demonstrations in bas-relief. So she and I got over the
surprise with few words and a single salute; yet I daresay she was
pleased, and I know I was. While we renewed old acquaintance,
Graham, sitting opposite, silently disposed of his paroxysm of
astonishment.</p>
<p id="id01240">"Mamma calls me a stupid boy, and I think I am so,"
at length he said; "for, upon my honour, often as I have seen you,
I never once suspected this fact: and yet I perceive it all now.
Lucy Snowe! To be sure! I recollect her perfectly, and there she
sits; not a doubt of it. But," he added, "you surely have not known
me as an old acquaintance all this time, and never mentioned
it."</p>
<p id="id01241">"That I have," was my answer.</p>
<p id="id01242">Dr. John commented not. I supposed he regarded my
silence as eccentric, but he was indulgent in refraining from
censure. I daresay, too, he would have deemed it impertinent to
have interrogated me very closely, to have asked me the why and
wherefore of my reserve; and, though he might feel a little
curious, the importance of the case was by no means such as to
tempt curiosity to infringe on discretion.</p>
<p id="id01243">For my part, I just ventured to inquire whether he
remembered the circumstance of my once looking at him very fixedly;
for the slight annoyance he had betrayed on that occasion still
lingered sore on my mind.</p>
<p id="id01244">"I think I do!" said he: "I think I was even cross
with you."</p>
<p id="id01245">"You considered me a little bold; perhaps?" I
inquired.</p>
<p id="id01246">"Not at all. Only, shy and retiring as your general
manner was, I wondered what personal or facial enormity in me
proved so magnetic to your usually averted eyes."</p>
<p id="id01247">"You see how it was now?"</p>
<p id="id01248">"Perfectly."</p>
<p id="id01249">And here Mrs. Bretton broke in with many, many
questions about past times; and for her satisfaction I had to recur
to gone-by troubles, to explain causes of seeming estrangement, to
touch on single-handed conflict with Life, with Death, with Grief,
with Fate. Dr. John listened, saying little. He and she then told
me of changes they had known: even with them all had not gone
smoothly, and fortune had retrenched her once abundant gifts. But
so courageous a mother, with such a champion in her son, was well
fitted to fight a good fight with the world, and to prevail
ultimately. Dr. John himself was one of those on whose birth benign
planets have certainly smiled. Adversity might set against him her
most sullen front: he was the man to beat her down with smiles.
Strong and cheerful, and firm and courteous; not rash, yet valiant;
he was the aspirant to woo Destiny herself, and to win from her
stone eyeballs a beam almost loving.</p>
<p id="id01250">In the profession he had adopted, his success was
now quite decided. Within the last three months he had taken this
house (a small ch&Atilde;&cent;teau, they told me, about half a
league without the Porte de Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy); this country site
being chosen for the sake of his mother's health, with which town
air did not now agree. Hither he had invited Mrs. Bretton, and she,
on leaving England, had brought with her such residue furniture of
the former St. Ann's Street mansion as she had thought fit to keep
unsold. Hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs, and the
wraiths of looking-glasses, tea-urns, and teacups.</p>
<p id="id01251">As the clock struck eleven, Dr. John stopped his
mother.</p>
<p id="id01252">"Miss Snowe must retire now," he said; "she is
beginning to look very pale. To-morrow I will venture to put some
questions respecting the cause of her loss of health. She is much
changed, indeed, since last July, when I saw her enact with no
little spirit the part of a very killing fine gentleman. As to last
night's catastrophe, I am sure thereby hangs a tale, but we will
inquire no further this evening. Good-night, Miss Lucy."</p>
<p id="id01253">And so he kindly led me to the door, and holding a
wax-candle, lighted me up the one flight of stairs.</p>
<p id="id01254">When I had said my prayers, and when I was
undressed and laid down, I felt that I still had friends. Friends,
not professing vehement attachment, not offering the tender solace
of well-matched and congenial relationship; on whom, therefore, but
moderate demand of affection was to be made, of whom but moderate
expectation formed; but towards whom my heart softened
instinctively, and yearned with an importunate gratitude, which I
entreated Reason betimes to check.</p>
<p id="id01255">"Do not let me think of them too often, too much,
too fondly," I implored: "let me be content with a temperate
draught of this living stream: let me not run athirst, and apply
passionately to its welcome waters: let me not imagine in them a
sweeter taste than earth's fountains know. Oh! would to God I may
be enabled to feel enough sustained by an occasional, amicable
intercourse, rare, brief, unengrossing and tranquil: quite
tranquil!"</p>
<p id="id01256">Still repeating this word, I turned to my pillow;
and <i>still</i> repeating it, I steeped that pillow with
tears.</p>
<h2 id="id01257" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h5 id="id01258">LA TERRASSE.</h5>
<p id="id01259" style="margin-top: 2em">These struggles with the
natural character, the strong native bent of the heart, may seem
futile and fruitless, but in the end they do good. They tend,
however slightly, to give the actions, the conduct, that turn which
Reason approves, and which Feeling, perhaps, too often opposes:
they certainly make a difference in the general tenour of a life,
and enable it to be better regulated, more equable, quieter on the
surface; and it is on the surface only the common gaze will fall.
As to what lies below, leave that with God. Man, your equal, weak
as you, and not fit to be your judge, may be shut out thence: take
it to your Maker&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;show Him the secrets of the
spirit He gave&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ask Him how you are to bear the
pains He has appointed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;kneel in His presence,
and pray with faith for light in darkness, for strength in piteous
weakness, for patience in extreme need. Certainly, at some hour,
though perhaps not <i>your</i> hour, the waiting waters will stir;
in <i>some</i> shape, though perhaps not the shape you dreamed,
which your heart loved, and for which it bled, the healing herald
will descend, the cripple and the blind, and the dumb, and the
possessed will be led to bathe. Herald, come quickly! Thousands lie
round the pool, weeping and despairing, to see it, through slow
years, stagnant. Long are the "times" of Heaven: the orbits of
angel messengers seem wide to mortal vision; they may enring ages:
the cycle of one departure and return may clasp unnumbered
generations; and dust, kindling to brief suffering life, and
through pain, passing back to dust, may meanwhile perish out of
memory again, and yet again. To how many maimed and mourning
millions is the first and sole angel visitant, him easterns call
Azrael!</p>
<p id="id01260">I tried to get up next morning, but while I was
dressing, and at intervals drinking cold water from the
<i>carafe</i> on my washstand, with design to brace up that
trembling weakness which made dressing so difficult, in came Mrs.
Bretton.</p>
<p id="id01261">"Here is an absurdity!" was her morning accost.
"Not so," she added, and dealing with me at once in her own
brusque, energetic fashion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that fashion which I
used formerly to enjoy seeing applied to her son, and by him
vigorously resisted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in two minutes she consigned
me captive to the French bed.</p>
<p id="id01262">"There you lie till afternoon," said she. "My boy
left orders before he went out that such should be the case, and I
can assure you my son is master and must be obeyed. Presently you
shall have breakfast."</p>
<p id="id01263">Presently she brought that
meal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;brought it with her own active
hands&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not leaving me to servants. She seated
herself on the bed while I ate. Now it is not everybody, even
amongst our respected friends and esteemed acquaintance, whom we
like to have near us, whom we like to watch us, to wait on us, to
approach us with the proximity of a nurse to a patient. It is not
every friend whose eye is a light in a sick room, whose presence is
there a solace: but all this was Mrs. Bretton to me; all this she
had ever been. Food or drink never pleased me so well as when it
came through her hands. I do not remember the occasion when her
entrance into a room had not made that room cheerier. Our natures
own predilections and antipathies alike strange. There are people
from whom we secretly shrink, whom we would personally avoid,
though reason confesses that they are good people: there are others
with faults of temper, &amp;c., evident enough, beside whom we live
content, as if the air about them did us good. My godmother's
lively black eye and clear brunette cheek, her warm, prompt hand,
her self-reliant mood, her decided bearing, were all beneficial to
me as the atmosphere of some salubrious climate. Her son used to
call her "the old lady;" it filled me with pleasant wonder to note
how the alacrity and power of five-and-twenty still breathed from
her and around her.</p>
<p id="id01264">"I would bring my work here," she said, as she took
from me the emptied teacup, "and sit with you the whole day, if
that overbearing John Graham had not put his veto upon such a
proceeding. 'Now, mamma,' he said, when he went out, 'take notice,
you are not to knock up your god-daughter with gossip,' and he
particularly desired me to keep close to my own quarters, and spare
you my fine company. He says, Lucy, he thinks you have had a
nervous fever, judging from your look,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is that
so?"</p>
<p id="id01265">I replied that I did not quite know what my ailment
had been, but that I had certainly suffered a good deal especially
in mind. Further, on this subject, I did not consider it advisable
to dwell, for the details of what I had undergone belonged to a
portion of my existence in which I never expected my godmother to
take a share. Into what a new region would such a confidence have
led that hale, serene nature! The difference between her and me
might be figured by that between the stately ship cruising safe on
smooth seas, with its full complement of crew, a captain gay and
brave, and venturous and provident; and the life-boat, which most
days of the year lies dry and solitary in an old, dark boat-house,
only putting to sea when the billows run high in rough weather,
when cloud encounters water, when danger and death divide between
them the rule of the great deep. No, the "Louisa Bretton" never was
out of harbour on such a night, and in such a scene: her crew could
not conceive it; so the half-drowned life-boat man keeps his own
counsel, and spins no yarns.</p>
<p id="id01266">She left me, and I lay in bed content: it was good
of Graham to remember me before he went out.</p>
<p id="id01267">My day was lonely, but the prospect of coming
evening abridged and cheered it. Then, too, I felt weak, and rest
seemed welcome; and after the morning hours were gone
by,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;those hours which always bring, even to the
necessarily unoccupied, a sense of business to be done, of tasks
waiting fulfilment, a vague impression of obligation to be
employed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when this stirring time was past, and
the silent descent of afternoon hushed housemaid steps on the
stairs and in the chambers, I then passed into a dreamy mood, not
unpleasant.</p>
<p id="id01268">My calm little room seemed somehow like a cave in
the sea. There was no colour about it, except that white and pale
green, suggestive of foam and deep water; the blanched cornice was
adorned with shell-shaped ornaments, and there were white mouldings
like dolphins in the ceiling-angles. Even that one touch of colour
visible in the red satin pincushion bore affinity to coral; even
that dark, shining glass might have mirrored a mermaid. When I
closed my eyes, I heard a gale, subsiding at last, bearing upon the
house-front like a settling swell upon a rock-base. I heard it
drawn and withdrawn far, far off, like a tide retiring from a shore
of the upper world&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a world so high above that
the rush of its largest waves, the dash of its fiercest breakers,
could sound down in this submarine home, only like murmurs and a
lullaby.</p>
<p id="id01269">Amidst these dreams came evening, and then Martha
brought a light; with her aid I was quickly dressed, and stronger
now than in the morning, I made my way down to the blue saloon
unassisted.</p>
<p id="id01270">Dr. John, it appears, had concluded his round of
professional calls earlier than usual; his form was the first
object that met my eyes as I entered the parlour; he stood in that
window-recess opposite the door, reading the close type of a
newspaper by such dull light as closing day yet gave. The fire
shone clear, but the lamp stood on the table unlit, and tea was not
yet brought up.</p>
<p id="id01271">As to Mrs. Bretton, my active
godmother&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who, I afterwards found, had been out
in the open air all day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;lay half-reclined in her
deep-cushioned chair, actually lost in a nap. Her son seeing me,
came forward. I noticed that he trod carefully, not to wake the
sleeper; he also spoke low: his mellow voice never had any
sharpness in it; modulated as at present, it was calculated rather
to soothe than startle slumber.</p>
<p id="id01272">"This is a quiet little ch&Atilde;&cent;teau," he
observed, after inviting me to sit near the casement. "I don't know
whether you may have noticed it in your walks: though, indeed, from
the chauss&Atilde;&copy;e it is not visible; just a mile beyond the
Porte de Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy, you turn down a lane which soon
becomes an avenue, and that leads you on, through meadow and shade,
to the very door of this house. It is not a modern place, but built
somewhat in the old style of the Basse-Ville. It is rather a manoir
than a ch&Atilde;&cent;teau; they call it 'La Terrasse,' because
its front rises from a broad turfed walk, whence steps lead down a
grassy slope to the avenue. See yonder! The moon rises: she looks
well through the tree-boles."</p>
<p id="id01273">Where, indeed, does the moon not look well? What is
the scene, confined or expansive, which her orb does not hallow?
Rosy or fiery, she mounted now above a not distant bank; even while
we watched her flushed ascent, she cleared to gold, and in very
brief space, floated up stainless into a now calm sky. Did
moonlight soften or sadden Dr. Bretton? Did it touch him with
romance? I think it did. Albeit of no sighing mood, he sighed in
watching it: sighed to himself quietly. No need to ponder the cause
or the course of that sigh; I knew it was wakened by beauty; I knew
it pursued Ginevra. Knowing this, the idea pressed upon me that it
was in some sort my duty to speak the name he meditated. Of course
he was ready for the subject: I saw in his countenance a teeming
plenitude of comment, question and interest; a pressure of language
and sentiment, only checked, I thought, by sense of embarrassment
how to begin. To spare him this embarrassment was my best, indeed
my sole use. I had but to utter the idol's name, and love's tender
litany would flow out. I had just found a fitting phrase, "You know
that Miss Fanshawe is gone on a tour with the Cholmondeleys," and
was opening my lips to speak to it, when he scattered my plans by
introducing another theme.</p>
<p id="id01274">"The first thing this morning," said he, putting
his sentiment in his pocket, turning from the moon, and sitting
down, "I went to the Rue Fossette, and told the
cuisini&Atilde;&uml;re that you were safe and in good hands. Do you
know that I actually found that she had not yet discovered your
absence from the house: she thought you safe in the great
dormitory. With what care you must have been waited on!"</p>
<p id="id01275">"Oh! all that is very conceivable," said I. "Goton
could do nothing for me but bring me a little tisane and a crust of
bread, and I had rejected both so often during the past week, that
the good woman got tired of useless journeys from the
dwelling-house kitchen to the school-dormitory, and only came once
a day at noon to make my bed. I believe, however, that she is a
good-natured creature, and would have been delighted to cook me
c&Atilde;&acute;telettes de mouton, if I could have eaten
them."</p>
<p id="id01276">"What did Madame Beck mean by leaving you
alone?"</p>
<p id="id01277">"Madame Beck could not foresee that I should fall
ill."</p>
<p id="id01278">"Your nervous system bore a good share of the
suffering?"</p>
<p id="id01279">"I am not quite sure what my nervous system is, but
I was dreadfully low-spirited."</p>
<p id="id01280">"Which disables me from helping you by pill or
potion. Medicine can give nobody good spirits. My art halts at the
threshold of Hypochondria: she just looks in and sees a chamber of
torture, but can neither say nor do much. Cheerful society would be
of use; you should be as little alone as possible; you should take
plenty of exercise."</p>
<p id="id01281">Acquiescence and a pause followed these remarks.
They sounded all right, I thought, and bore the safe sanction of
custom, and the well-worn stamp of use.</p>
<p id="id01282">"Miss Snowe," recommenced Dr.
John&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my health, nervous system included, being
now, somewhat to my relief, discussed and done
with&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"is it permitted me to ask what your
religion is? Are you a Catholic?"</p>
<p id="id01283">I looked up in some surprise&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"A
Catholic? No! Why suggest such an idea?"</p>
<p id="id01284">"The manner in which you were consigned to me last
night made me doubt."</p>
<p id="id01285">"I consigned to you? But, indeed, I forget. It yet
remains for me to learn how I fell into your hands."</p>
<p id="id01286">"Why, under circumstances that puzzled me. I had
been in attendance all day yesterday on a case of singularly
interesting and critical character; the disease being rare, and its
treatment doubtful: I saw a similar and still finer case in a
hospital in Paris; but that will not interest you. At last a
mitigation of the patient's most urgent symptoms (acute pain is one
of its accompaniments) liberated me, and I set out homeward. My
shortest way lay through the Basse-Ville, and as the night was
excessively dark, wild, and wet, I took it. In riding past an old
church belonging to a community of B&Atilde;&copy;guines, I saw by
a lamp burning over the porch or deep arch of the entrance, a
priest lifting some object in his arms. The lamp was bright enough
to reveal the priest's features clearly, and I recognised him; he
was a man I have often met by the sick beds of both rich and poor:
and chiefly the latter. He is, I think, a good old man, far better
than most of his class in this country; superior, indeed, in every
way, better informed, as well as more devoted to duty. Our eyes
met; he called on me to stop: what he supported was a woman,
fainting or dying. I alighted.</p>
<p id="id01287">"'This person is one of your countrywomen,' he
said: 'save her, if she is not dead.'</p>
<p id="id01288">"My countrywoman, on examination, turned out to be
the English teacher at Madame Beck's pensionnat. She was perfectly
unconscious, perfectly bloodless, and nearly cold.</p>
<p id="id01289">"'What does it all mean?' was my inquiry.</p>
<p id="id01290">"He communicated a curious account; that you had
been to him that evening at confessional; that your exhausted and
suffering appearance, coupled with some things you had
said&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01291">"Things I had said? I wonder what things!"</p>
<p id="id01292">"Awful crimes, no doubt; but he did not tell me
what: there, you know, the seal of the confessional checked his
garrulity, and my curiosity. Your confidences, however, had not
made an enemy of the good father; it seems he was so struck, and
felt so sorry that you should be out on such a night alone, that he
had esteemed it a Christian duty to watch you when you quitted the
church, and so to manage as not to lose sight of you, till you
should have reached home. Perhaps the worthy man might, half
unconsciously, have blent in this proceeding some little of the
subtlety of his class: it might have been his resolve to learn the
locality of your home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;did you impart that in
your confession?"</p>
<p id="id01293">"I did not: on the contrary, I carefully avoided
the shadow of any indication: and as to my confession, Dr. John, I
suppose you will think me mad for taking such a step, but I could
not help it: I suppose it was all the fault of what you call my
'nervous system.' I cannot put the case into words, but my days and
nights were grown intolerable: a cruel sense of desolation pained
my mind: a feeling that would make its way, rush out, or kill
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;like (and this you will understand, Dr. John)
the current which passes through the heart, and which, if aneurism
or any other morbid cause obstructs its natural channels, seeks
abnormal outlet. I wanted companionship, I wanted friendship, I
wanted counsel. I could find none of these in closet or chamber, so
I went and sought them in church and confessional. As to what I
said, it was no confidence, no narrative. I have done nothing
wrong: my life has not been active enough for any dark deed, either
of romance or reality: all I poured out was a dreary, desperate
complaint."</p>
<p id="id01294">"Lucy, you ought to travel for about six months:
why, your calm nature is growing quite excitable! Confound Madame
Beck! Has the little buxom widow no bowels, to condemn her best
teacher to solitary confinement?"</p>
<p id="id01295">"It was not Madame Beck's fault," said I; "it is no
living being's fault, and I won't hear any one blamed."</p>
<p id="id01296">"Who is in the wrong, then, Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id01297">"Me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr.
John&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;me; and a great abstraction on whose wide
shoulders I like to lay the mountains of blame they were sculptured
to bear: me and Fate."</p>
<p id="id01298">"'Me' must take better care in future," said Dr.
John&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;smiling, I suppose, at my bad grammar.</p>
<p id="id01299">"Change of air&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;change of scene;
those are my prescriptions," pursued the practical young doctor.
"But to return to our muttons, Lucy. As yet, P&Atilde;&uml;re
Silas, with all his tact (they say he is a Jesuit), is no wiser
than you choose him to be; for, instead of returning to the Rue
Fossette, your fevered wanderings&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there must
have been high fever&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01300">"No, Dr. John: the fever took its turn that
night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;now, don't make out that I was delirious,
for I know differently."</p>
<p id="id01301">"Good! you were as collected as myself at this
moment, no doubt. Your wanderings had taken an opposite direction
to the pensionnat. Near the B&Atilde;&copy;guinage, amidst the
stress of flood and gust, and in the perplexity of darkness, you
had swooned and fallen. The priest came to your succour, and the
physician, as we have seen, supervened. Between us we procured a
fiacre and brought you here. P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas, old as he is,
would carry you up-stairs, and lay you on that couch himself. He
would certainly have remained with you till suspended animation had
been restored: and so should I, but, at that juncture, a hurried
messenger arrived from the dying patient I had scarcely
left&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the last duties were called
for&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the physician's last visit and the priest's
last rite; extreme unction could not be deferred. P&Atilde;&uml;re
Silas and myself departed together, my mother was spending the
evening abroad; we gave you in charge to Martha, leaving
directions, which it seems she followed successfully. Now, are you
a Catholic?"</p>
<p id="id01302">"Not yet," said I, with a smile. "And never let
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas know where I live, or he will try to convert
me; but give him my best and truest thanks when you see him, and if
ever I get rich I will send him money for his charities. See, Dr.
John, your mother wakes; you ought to ring for tea."</p>
<p id="id01303">Which he did; and, as Mrs. Bretton sat
up&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;astonished and indignant at herself for the
indulgence to which she had succumbed, and fully prepared to deny
that she had slept at all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her son came gaily to
the attack.</p>
<p id="id01304">"Hushaby, mamma! Sleep again. You look the picture
of innocence in your slumbers."</p>
<p id="id01305">"My slumbers, John Graham! What are you talking
about? You know I never <i>do</i> sleep by day: it was the
slightest doze possible."</p>
<p id="id01306">"Exactly! a seraph's gentle
lapse&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a fairy's dream. Mamma, under such
circumstances, you always remind me of Titania."</p>
<p id="id01307">"That is because you, yourself, are so like
Bottom."</p>
<p id="id01308">"Miss Snowe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;did you ever hear
anything like mamma's wit? She is a most sprightly woman of her
size and age."</p>
<p id="id01309">"Keep your compliments to yourself, sir, and do not
neglect your own size: which seems to me a good deal on the
increase. Lucy, has he not rather the air of an incipient John
Bull? He used to be slender as an eel, and now I fancy in him a
sort of heavy dragoon bent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a beef-eater
tendency. Graham, take notice! If you grow fat I disown you."</p>
<p id="id01310">"As if you could not sooner disown your own
personality! I am indispensable to the old lady's happiness, Lucy.
She would pine away in green and yellow melancholy if she had not
my six feet of iniquity to scold. It keeps her
lively&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it maintains the wholesome ferment of her
spirits."</p>
<p id="id01311">The two were now standing opposite to each other,
one on each side the fire-place; their words were not very fond,
but their mutual looks atoned for verbal deficiencies. At least,
the best treasure of Mrs. Bretton's life was certainly casketed in
her son's bosom; her dearest pulse throbbed in his heart. As to
him, of course another love shared his feelings with filial love,
and, no doubt, as the new passion was the latest born, so he
assigned it in his emotions Benjamin's portion. Ginevra! Ginevra!
Did Mrs. Bretton yet know at whose feet her own young idol had laid
his homage? Would she approve that choice? I could not tell; but I
could well guess that if she knew Miss Fanshawe's conduct towards
Graham: her alternations between coldness and coaxing, and repulse
and allurement; if she could at all suspect the pain with which she
had tried him; if she could have seen, as I had seen, his fine
spirits subdued and harassed, his inferior preferred before him,
his subordinate made the instrument of his
humiliation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>then</i> Mrs. Bretton would have
pronounced Ginevra imbecile, or perverted, or both.
Well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I thought so too.</p>
<p id="id01312">That second evening passed as sweetly as the
first&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>more</i> sweetly indeed: we enjoyed a
smoother interchange of thought; old troubles were not reverted to,
acquaintance was better cemented; I felt happier, easier, more at
home. That night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;instead of crying myself
asleep&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I went down to dreamland by a pathway
bordered with pleasant thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="id01313" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h5 id="id01314">WE QUARREL.</h5>
<p id="id01315" style="margin-top: 2em">During the first days of my
stay at the Terrace, Graham never took a seat near me, or in his
frequent pacing of the room approached the quarter where I sat, or
looked pre-occupied, or more grave than usual, but I thought of
Miss Fanshawe and expected her name to leap from his lips. I kept
my ear and mind in perpetual readiness for the tender theme; my
patience was ordered to be permanently under arms, and my sympathy
desired to keep its cornucopia replenished and ready for
outpouring. At last, and after a little inward struggle, which I
saw and respected, he one day launched into the topic. It was
introduced delicately; anonymously as it were.</p>
<p id="id01316">"Your friend is spending her vacation in
travelling, I hear?"</p>
<p id="id01317">"Friend, forsooth!" thought I to myself: but it
would not do to contradict; he must have his own way; I must own
the soft impeachment: friend let it be. Still, by way of
experiment, I could not help asking whom he meant?</p>
<p id="id01318">He had taken a seat at my work-table; he now laid
hands on a reel of thread which he proceeded recklessly to
unwind.</p>
<p id="id01319">"Ginevra&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Miss Fanshawe, has
accompanied the Cholmondeleys on a tour through the south of
France?"</p>
<p id="id01320">"She has."</p>
<p id="id01321">"Do you and she correspond?"</p>
<p id="id01322">"It will astonish you to hear that I never once
thought of making application for that privilege."</p>
<p id="id01323">"You have seen letters of her writing?"</p>
<p id="id01324">"Yes; several to her uncle."</p>
<p id="id01325">"They will not be deficient in wit and
<i>na&Atilde;&macr;vet&Atilde;&copy;</i>; there is so much sparkle,
and so little art in her soul?"</p>
<p id="id01326">"She writes comprehensively enough when she writes
to M. de Bassompierre: he who runs may read." (In fact, Ginevra's
epistles to her wealthy kinsman were commonly business documents,
unequivocal applications for cash.)</p>
<p id="id01327">"And her handwriting? It must be pretty, light,
ladylike, I should think?"</p>
<p id="id01328">It was, and I said so.</p>
<p id="id01329">"I verily believe that all she does is well done,"
said Dr. John; and as I seemed in no hurry to chime in with this
remark, he added "You, who know her, could you name a point in
which she is deficient?"</p>
<p id="id01330">"She does several things very well." ("Flirtation
amongst the rest," subjoined I, in thought.)</p>
<p id="id01331">"When do you suppose she will return to town?" he
soon inquired.</p>
<p id="id01332">"Pardon me, Dr. John, I must explain. You honour me
too much in ascribing to me a degree of intimacy with Miss Fanshawe
I have not the felicity to enjoy. I have never been the depositary
of her plans and secrets. You will find her particular friends in
another sphere than mine: amongst the Cholmondeleys, for
instance."</p>
<p id="id01333">He actually thought I was stung with a kind of
jealous pain similar to his own!</p>
<p id="id01334">"Excuse her," he said; "judge her indulgently; the
glitter of fashion misleads her, but she will soon find out that
these people are hollow, and will return to you with augmented
attachment and confirmed trust. I know something of the
Cholmondeleys: superficial, showy, selfish people; depend on it, at
heart Ginevra values you beyond a score of such."</p>
<p id="id01335">"You are very kind," I said briefly.</p>
<p id="id01336">A disclaimer of the sentiments attributed to me
burned on my lips, but<br />
I extinguished the flame. I submitted to be looked upon as
the<br />
humiliated, cast-off, and now pining confidante of the
distinguished<br />
Miss Fanshawe: but, reader, it was a hard submission.<br /></p>
<p id="id01337">"Yet, you see," continued Graham, "while I comfort
<i>you</i>, I cannot take the same consolation to myself; I cannot
hope she will do me justice. De Hamal is most worthless, yet I fear
he pleases her: wretched delusion!"</p>
<p id="id01338">My patience really gave way, and without notice:
all at once. I suppose illness and weakness had worn it and made it
brittle.</p>
<p id="id01339">"Dr. Bretton," I broke out, "there is no delusion
like your own. On all points but one you are a man, frank,
healthful, right-thinking, clear-sighted: on this exceptional point
you are but a slave. I declare, where Miss Fanshawe is concerned,
you merit no respect; nor have you mine."</p>
<p id="id01340">I got up, and left the room very much excited.</p>
<p id="id01341">This little scene took place in the morning; I had
to meet him again in the evening, and then I saw I had done
mischief. He was not made of common clay, not put together out of
vulgar materials; while the outlines of his nature had been shaped
with breadth and vigour, the details embraced workmanship of almost
feminine delicacy: finer, much finer, than you could be prepared to
meet with; than you could believe inherent in him, even after years
of acquaintance. Indeed, till some over-sharp contact with his
nerves had betrayed, by its effects, their acute sensibility, this
elaborate construction must be ignored; and the more especially
because the sympathetic faculty was not prominent in him: to feel,
and to seize quickly another's feelings, are separate properties; a
few constructions possess both, some neither. Dr. John had the one
in exquisite perfection; and because I have admitted that he was
not endowed with the other in equal degree, the reader will
considerately refrain from passing to an extreme, and pronouncing
him _un_sympathizing, unfeeling: on the contrary, he was a kind,
generous man. Make your need known, his hand was open. Put your
grief into words, he turned no deaf ear. Expect refinements of
perception, miracles of intuition, and realize disappointment. This
night, when Dr. John entered the room, and met the evening lamp, I
saw well and at one glance his whole mechanism.</p>
<p id="id01342">To one who had named him "slave," and, on any
point, banned him from respect, he must now have peculiar feelings.
That the epithet was well applied, and the ban just, might be; he
put forth no denial that it was so: his mind even candidly revolved
that unmanning possibility. He sought in this accusation the cause
of that ill-success which had got so galling a hold on his mental
peace: Amid the worry of a self-condemnatory soliloquy, his
demeanour seemed grave, perhaps cold, both to me and his mother.
And yet there was no bad feeling, no malice, no rancour, no
littleness in his countenance, beautiful with a man's best beauty,
even in its depression. When I placed his chair at the table, which
I hastened to do, anticipating the servant, and when I handed him
his tea, which I did with trembling care, he said: "Thank you,
Lucy," in as kindly a tone of his full pleasant voice as ever my
ear welcomed.</p>
<p id="id01343">For my part, there was only one plan to be pursued;
I must expiate my culpable vehemence, or I must not sleep that
night. This would not do at all; I could not stand it: I made no
pretence of capacity to wage war on this footing. School solitude,
conventual silence and stagnation, anything seemed preferable to
living embroiled with Dr. John. As to Ginevra, she might take the
silver wings of a dove, or any other fowl that flies, and mount
straight up to the highest place, among the highest stars, where
her lover's highest flight of fancy chose to fix the constellation
of her charms: never more be it mine to dispute the arrangement.
Long I tried to catch his eye. Again and again that eye just met
mine; but, having nothing to say, it withdrew, and I was baffled.
After tea, he sat, sad and quiet, reading a book. I wished I could
have dared to go and sit near him, but it seemed that if I ventured
to take that step, he would infallibly evince hostility and
indignation. I longed to speak out, and I dared not whisper. His
mother left the room; then, moved by insupportable regret, I just
murmured the words "Dr. Bretton."</p>
<p id="id01344">He looked up from his book; his eyes were not cold
or malevolent, his mouth was not cynical; he was ready and willing
to hear what I might have to say: his spirit was of vintage too
mellow and generous to sour in one thunder-clap.</p>
<p id="id01345">"Dr. Bretton, forgive my hasty words: <i>do, do</i>
forgive them."</p>
<p id="id01346">He smiled that moment I spoke. "Perhaps I deserved
them, Lucy. If you don't respect me, I am sure it is because I am
not respectable. I fear, I am an awkward fool: I must manage badly
in some way, for where I wish to please, it seems I don't
please."</p>
<p id="id01347">"Of that you cannot be sure; and even if such be
the case, is it the fault of your character, or of another's
perceptions? But now, let me unsay what I said in anger. In one
thing, and in all things, I deeply respect you. If you think
scarcely enough of yourself, and too much of others, what is that
but an excellence?"</p>
<p id="id01348">"Can I think too much of Ginevra?"</p>
<p id="id01349">"<i>I</i> believe you may; <i>you</i> believe you
can't. Let us agree to differ. Let me be pardoned; that is what I
ask."</p>
<p id="id01350">"Do you think I cherish ill-will for one warm
word?"</p>
<p id="id01351">"I see you do not and cannot; but just say, 'Lucy,
I forgive you!' Say that, to ease me of the heart-ache."</p>
<p id="id01352">"Put away your heart-ache, as I will put away mine;
for you wounded me a little, Lucy. Now, when the pain is gone, I
more than forgive: I feel grateful, as to a sincere
well-wisher."</p>
<p id="id01353">"I <i>am</i> your sincere well-wisher: you are
right."</p>
<p id="id01354">Thus our quarrel ended.</p>
<p id="id01355">Reader, if in the course of this work, you find
that my opinion of Dr. John undergoes modification, excuse the
seeming inconsistency. I give the feeling as at the time I felt it;
I describe the view of character as it appeared when
discovered.</p>
<p id="id01356">He showed the fineness of his nature by being
kinder to me after that misunderstanding than before. Nay, the very
incident which, by my theory, must in some degree estrange me and
him, changed, indeed, somewhat our relations; but not in the sense
I painfully anticipated. An invisible, but a cold something, very
slight, very transparent, but very chill: a sort of screen of ice
had hitherto, all through our two lives, glazed the medium through
which we exchanged intercourse. Those few warm words, though only
warm with anger, breathed on that frail frost-work of reserve;
about this time, it gave note of dissolution. I think from that
day, so long as we continued friends, he never in discourse stood
on topics of ceremony with me. He seemed to know that if he would
but talk about himself, and about that in which he was most
interested, my expectation would always be answered, my wish always
satisfied. It follows, as a matter of course, that I continued to
hear much of "Ginevra."</p>
<p id="id01357">"Ginevra!" He thought her so fair, so good; he
spoke so lovingly of her charms, her sweetness, her innocence,
that, in spite of my plain prose knowledge of the reality, a kind
of reflected glow began to settle on her idea, even for me. Still,
reader, I am free to confess, that he often talked nonsense; but I
strove to be unfailingly patient with him. I had had my lesson: I
had learned how severe for me was the pain of crossing, or
grieving, or disappointing him. In a strange and new sense, I grew
most selfish, and quite powerless to deny myself the delight of
indulging his mood, and being pliant to his will. He still seemed
to me most absurd when he obstinately doubted, and desponded about
his power to win in the end Miss Fanshawe's preference. The fancy
became rooted in my own mind more stubbornly than ever, that she
was only coquetting to goad him, and that, at heart, she coveted
everyone of his words and looks. Sometimes he harassed me, in spite
of my resolution to bear and hear; in the midst of the
indescribable gall-honey pleasure of thus bearing and hearing, he
struck so on the flint of what firmness I owned, that it emitted
fire once and again. I chanced to assert one day, with a view to
stilling his impatience, that in my own mind, I felt positive Miss
Fanshawe <i>must</i> intend eventually to accept him.</p>
<p id="id01358">"Positive! It was easy to say so, but had I any
grounds for such assurance?"</p>
<p id="id01359">"The best grounds."</p>
<p id="id01360">"Now, Lucy, <i>do</i> tell me what!"</p>
<p id="id01361">"You know them as well as I; and, knowing them, Dr.
John, it really amazes me that you should not repose the frankest
confidence in her fidelity. To doubt, under the circumstances, is
almost to insult."</p>
<p id="id01362">"Now you are beginning to speak fast and to breathe
short; but speak a little faster and breathe a little shorter, till
you have given an explanation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a full
explanation: I must have it."</p>
<p id="id01363">"You shall, Dr. John. In some cases, you are a
lavish, generous man: you are a worshipper ever ready with the
votive offering should P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas ever convert
<i>you</i>, you will give him abundance of alms for his poor, you
will supply his altar with tapers, and the shrine of your favourite
saint you will do your best to enrich: Ginevra, Dr.
John&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01364">"Hush!" said he, "don't go on."</p>
<p id="id01365">"Hush, I will <i>not</i>: and go on I <i>will</i>:
Ginevra has had her hands filled from your hands more times than I
can count. You have sought for her the costliest flowers; you have
busied your brain in devising gifts the most delicate: such, one
would have thought, as only a woman could have imagined; and in
addition, Miss Fanshawe owns a set of ornaments, to purchase which
your generosity must have verged on extravagance."</p>
<p id="id01366">The modesty Ginevra herself had never evinced in
this matter, now flushed all over the face of her admirer.</p>
<p id="id01367">"Nonsense!" he said, destructively snipping a skein
of silk with my scissors. "I offered them to please myself: I felt
she did me a favour in accepting them."</p>
<p id="id01368">"She did more than a favour, Dr. John: she pledged
her very honour that she would make you some return; and if she
cannot pay you in affection, she ought to hand out a business-like
equivalent, in the shape of some rouleaux of gold pieces."</p>
<p id="id01369">"But you don't understand her; she is far too
disinterested to care for my gifts, and too simple-minded to know
their value."</p>
<p id="id01370">I laughed out: I had heard her adjudge to every
jewel its price; and well I knew money-embarrassment,
money-schemes; money's worth, and endeavours to realise supplies,
had, young as she was, furnished the most frequent, and the
favourite stimulus of her thoughts for years.</p>
<p id="id01371">He pursued. "You should have seen her whenever I
have laid on her lap some trifle; so cool, so unmoved: no eagerness
to take, not even pleasure in contemplating. Just from amiable
reluctance to grieve me, she would permit the bouquet to lie beside
her, and perhaps consent to bear it away. Or, if I achieved the
fastening of a bracelet on her ivory arm, however pretty the
trinket might be (and I always carefully chose what seemed to
<i>me</i> pretty, and what of course was not valueless), the
glitter never dazzled her bright eyes: she would hardly cast one
look on my gift."</p>
<p id="id01372">"Then, of course, not valuing it, she would
unloose, and return it to you?"</p>
<p id="id01373">"No; for such a repulse she was too good-natured.
She would consent to seem to forget what I had done, and retain the
offering with lady-like quiet and easy oblivion. Under such
circumstances, how can a man build on acceptance of his presents as
a favourable symptom? For my part, were I to offer her all I have,
and she to take it, such is her incapacity to be swayed by sordid
considerations, I should not venture to believe the transaction
advanced me one step."</p>
<p id="id01374">"Dr. John," I began, "Love is blind;" but just then
a blue subtle ray sped sideways from Dr. John's eye: it reminded me
of old days, it reminded me of his picture: it half led me to think
that part, at least, of his professed persuasion of Miss Fanshawe's
<i>na&Atilde;&macr;vet&Atilde;&copy;</i> was assumed; it led me
dubiously to conjecture that perhaps, in spite of his passion for
her beauty, his appreciation of her foibles might possibly be less
mistaken, more clear-sighted, than from his general language was
presumable. After all it might be only a chance look, or at best
the token of a merely momentary impression. Chance or intentional
real or imaginary, it closed the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="id01375" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h5 id="id01376">THE CLEOPATRA.</h5>
<p id="id01377" style="margin-top: 2em">My stay at La Terrasse was
prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of the vacation. Mrs.
Bretton's kind management procured me this respite. Her son having
one day delivered the dictum that "Lucy was not yet strong enough
to go back to that den of a pensionnat," she at once drove over to
the Rue Fossette, had an interview with the directress, and
procured the indulgence, on the plea of prolonged rest and change
being necessary to perfect recovery. Hereupon, however, followed an
attention I could very well have dispensed with,
viz&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a polite call from Madame Beck.</p>
<p id="id01378">That lady&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one fine
day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;actually came out in a fiacre as far as the
ch&Atilde;&cent;teau. I suppose she had resolved within herself to
see what manner of place Dr. John inhabited. Apparently, the
pleasant site and neat interior surpassed her expectations; she
eulogized all she saw, pronounced the blue salon "une
pi&Atilde;&uml;ce magnifique," profusely congratulated me on the
acquisition of friends, "tellement dignes, aimables, et
respectables," turned also a neat compliment in my favour, and,
upon Dr. John coming in, ran up to him with the utmost buoyancy,
opening at the same time such a fire of rapid language, all
sparkling with felicitations and protestations about his
"ch&Atilde;&cent;teau,"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"madame sa
m&Atilde;&uml;re, la digne ch&Atilde;&cent;telaine:" also his
looks; which, indeed, were very flourishing, and at the moment
additionally embellished by the good-natured but amused smile with
which he always listened to Madame's fluent and florid French. In
short, Madame shone in her very best phase that day, and came in
and went out quite a living catherine-wheel of compliments,
delight, and affability. Half purposely, and half to ask some
question about school-business, I followed her to the carriage, and
looked in after she was seated and the door closed. In that brief
fraction of time what a change had been wrought! An instant ago,
all sparkles and jests, she now sat sterner than a judge and graver
than a sage. Strange little woman!</p>
<p id="id01379">I went back and teased Dr. John about Madame's
devotion to him. How he laughed! What fun shone in his eyes as he
recalled some of her fine speeches, and repeated them, imitating
her voluble delivery! He had an acute sense of humour, and was the
finest company in the world&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when he could forget
Miss Fanshawe.</p>
<p id="id01380">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id01381">To "sit in sunshine calm and sweet" is said to be
excellent for weak people; it gives them vital force. When little
Georgette Beck was recovering from her illness, I used to take her
in my arms and walk with her in the garden by the hour together,
beneath a certain wall hung with grapes, which the Southern sun was
ripening: that sun cherished her little pale frame quite as
effectually as it mellowed and swelled the clustering fruit.</p>
<p id="id01382">There are human tempers, bland, glowing, and
genial, within whose influence it is as good for the poor in spirit
to live, as it is for the feeble in frame to bask in the glow of
noon. Of the number of these choice natures were certainly both Dr.
Bretton's and his mother's. They liked to communicate happiness, as
some like to occasion misery: they did it instinctively; without
fuss, and apparently with little consciousness; the means to give
pleasure rose spontaneously in their minds. Every day while I
stayed with them, some little plan was proposed which resulted in
beneficial enjoyment. Fully occupied as was Dr. John's time, he
still made it in his way to accompany us in each brief excursion. I
can hardly tell how he managed his engagements; they were numerous,
yet by dint of system, he classed them in an order which left him a
daily period of liberty. I often saw him hard-worked, yet seldom
over-driven, and never irritated, confused, or oppressed. What he
did was accomplished with the ease and grace of all-sufficing
strength; with the bountiful cheerfulness of high and unbroken
energies. Under his guidance I saw, in that one happy fortnight,
more of Villette, its environs, and its inhabitants, than I had
seen in the whole eight months of my previous residence. He took me
to places of interest in the town, of whose names I had not before
so much as heard; with willingness and spirit he communicates much
noteworthy information. He never seemed to think it a trouble to
talk to me, and, I am sure, it was never a task to me to listen. It
was not his way to treat subjects coldly and vaguely; he rarely
generalized, never prosed. He seemed to like nice details almost as
much as I liked them myself: he seemed observant of character: and
not superficially observant, either. These points gave the quality
of interest to his discourse; and the fact of his speaking direct
from his own resources, and not borrowing or stealing from
books&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;here a dry fact, and there a trite phrase,
and elsewhere a hackneyed opinion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ensured a
freshness, as welcome as it was rare. Before my eyes, too, his
disposition seemed to unfold another phase; to pass to a fresh day:
to rise in new and nobler dawn.</p>
<p id="id01383">His mother possessed a good development of
benevolence, but he owned a better and larger. I found, on
accompanying him to the Basse-Ville&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the poor and
crowded quarter of the city&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that his errands
there were as much those of the philanthropist as the physician. I
understood presently that cheerfully, habitually, and in
single-minded unconsciousness of any special merit distinguishing
his deeds&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was achieving, amongst a very
wretched population, a world of active good. The lower orders liked
him well; his poor, patients in the hospitals welcomed him with a
sort of enthusiasm.</p>
<p id="id01384">But stop&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I must not, from the
faithful narrator, degenerate into the partial eulogist. Well, full
well, do I know that Dr. John was not perfect, anymore than I am
perfect. Human fallibility leavened him throughout: there was no
hour, and scarcely a moment of the time I spent with him that in
act or speech, or look, he did not betray something that was not of
a god. A god could not have the cruel vanity of Dr. John, nor his
sometime levity., No immortal could have resembled him in his
occasional temporary oblivion of all but the
present&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in his passing passion for that present;
shown not coarsely, by devoting it to material indulgence, but
selfishly, by extracting from it whatever it could yield of
nutriment to his masculine self-love: his delight was to feed that
ravenous sentiment, without thought of the price of provender, or
care for the cost of keeping it sleek and high-pampered.</p>
<p id="id01385">The reader is requested to note a seeming
contradiction in the two views which have been given of Graham
Bretton&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the public and
private&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the out-door and the in-door view. In
the first, the public, he is shown oblivious of self; as modest in
the display of his energies, as earnest in their exercise. In the
second, the fireside picture, there is expressed consciousness of
what he has and what he is; pleasure in homage, some recklessness
in exciting, some vanity in receiving the same. Both portraits are
correct.</p>
<p id="id01386">It was hardly possible to oblige Dr. John quietly
and in secret. When you thought that the fabrication of some trifle
dedicated to his use had been achieved unnoticed, and that, like
other men, he would use it when placed ready for his use, and never
ask whence it came, he amazed you by a smilingly-uttered
observation or two, proving that his eye had been on the work from
commencement to close: that he had noted the design, traced its
progress, and marked its completion. It pleased him to be thus
served, and he let his pleasure beam in his eye and play about his
mouth.</p>
<p id="id01387">This would have been all very well, if he had not
added to such kindly and unobtrusive evidence a certain wilfulness
in discharging what he called debts. When his mother worked for
him, he paid her by showering about her his bright animal spirits,
with even more affluence than his gay, taunting, teasing, loving
wont. If Lucy Snowe were discovered to have put her hand to such
work, he planned, in recompence, some pleasant recreation.</p>
<p id="id01388">I often felt amazed at his perfect knowledge of
Villette; a knowledge not merely confined to its open streets, but
penetrating to all its galleries, salles, and cabinets: of every
door which shut in an object worth seeing, of every museum, of
every hall, sacred to art or science, he seemed to possess the
"Open! Sesame." I never had a head for science, but an ignorant,
blind, fond instinct inclined me to art. I liked to visit the
picture-galleries, and I dearly liked to be left there alone. In
company, a wretched idiosyncracy forbade me to see much or to feel
anything. In unfamiliar company, where it was necessary to maintain
a flow of talk on the subjects in presence, half an hour would
knock me up, with a combined pressure of physical lassitude and
entire mental incapacity. I never yet saw the well-reared child,
much less the educated adult, who could not put me to shame, by the
sustained intelligence of its demeanour under the ordeal of a
conversable, sociable visitation of pictures, historical sights or
buildings, or any lions of public interest. Dr. Bretton was a
cicerone after my own heart; he would take me betimes, ere the
galleries were filled, leave me there for two or three hours, and
call for me when his own engagements were discharged. Meantime, I
was happy; happy, not always in admiring, but in examining,
questioning, and forming conclusions. In the commencement of these
visits, there was some misunderstanding and consequent struggle
between Will and Power. The former faculty exacted approbation of
that which it was considered orthodox to admire; the latter groaned
forth its utter inability to pay the tax; it was then self-sneered
at, spurred up, goaded on to refine its taste, and whet its zest.
The more it was chidden, however, the more it wouldn't praise.
Discovering gradually that a wonderful sense of fatigue resulted
from these conscientious efforts, I began to reflect whether I
might not dispense with that great labour, and concluded eventually
that I might, and so sank supine into a luxury of calm before
ninety-nine out of a hundred of the exhibited frames.</p>
<p id="id01389">It seemed to me that an original and good picture
was just as scarce as an original and good book; nor did I, in the
end, tremble to say to myself, standing before certain
<i>chef-d'oeuvres</i> bearing great names, "These are not a whit
like nature. Nature's daylight never had that colour: never was
made so turbid, either by storm or cloud, as it is laid out there,
under a sky of indigo: and that indigo is not ether; and those dark
weeds plastered upon it are not trees." Several very well executed
and complacent-looking fat women struck me as by no means the
goddesses they appeared to consider themselves. Many scores of
marvellously-finished little Flemish pictures, and also of
sketches, excellent for fashion-books displaying varied costumes in
the handsomest materials, gave evidence of laudable industry
whimsically applied. And yet there were fragments of truth here and
there which satisfied the conscience, and gleams of light that
cheered the vision. Nature's power here broke through in a mountain
snow-storm; and there her glory in a sunny southern day. An
expression in this portrait proved clear insight into character; a
face in that historical painting, by its vivid filial likeness,
startlingly reminded you that genius gave it birth. These
exceptions I loved: they grew dear as friends.</p>
<p id="id01390">One day, at a quiet early hour, I found myself
nearly alone in a certain gallery, wherein one particular picture
of portentous size, set up in the best light, having a cordon of
protection stretched before it, and a cushioned bench duly set in
front for the accommodation of worshipping connoisseurs, who,
having gazed themselves off their feet, might be fain to complete
the business sitting: this picture, I say, seemed to consider
itself the queen of the collection.</p>
<p id="id01391">It represented a woman, considerably larger, I
thought, than the life. I calculated that this lady, put into a
scale of magnitude, suitable for the reception of a commodity of
bulk, would infallibly turn from fourteen to sixteen stone. She
was, indeed, extremely well fed: very much butcher's
meat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to say nothing of bread, vegetables, and
liquids&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;must she have consumed to attain that
breadth and height, that wealth of muscle, that affluence of flesh.
She lay half-reclined on a couch: why, it would be difficult to
say; broad daylight blazed round her; she appeared in hearty
health, strong enough to do the work of two plain cooks; she could
not plead a weak spine; she ought to have been standing, or at
least sitting bolt upright. She, had no business to lounge away the
noon on a sofa. She ought likewise to have worn decent garments; a
gown covering her properly, which was not the case: out of
abundance of material&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;seven-and-twenty yards, I
should say, of drapery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she managed to make
inefficient raiment. Then, for the wretched untidiness surrounding
her, there could be no excuse. Pots and
pans&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps I ought to say vases and
goblets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were rolled here and there on the
foreground; a perfect rubbish of flowers was mixed amongst them,
and an absurd and disorderly mass of curtain upholstery smothered
the couch and cumbered the floor. On referring to the catalogue, I
found that this notable production bore the name "Cleopatra."</p>
<p id="id01392">Well, I was sitting wondering at it (as the bench
was there, I thought I might as well take advantage of its
accommodation), and thinking that while some of the
details&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as roses, gold cups, jewels, &amp;c.,
were very prettily painted, it was on the whole an enormous piece
of claptrap; the room, almost vacant when I entered, began to fill.
Scarcely noticing this circumstance (as, indeed, it did not matter
to me) I retained my seat; rather to rest myself than with a view
to studying this huge, dark-complexioned gipsy-queen; of whom,
indeed, I soon tired, and betook myself for refreshment to the
contemplation of some exquisite little pictures of still life:
wild-flowers, wild-fruit, mossy woodnests, casketing eggs that
looked like pearls seen through clear green sea-water; all hung
modestly beneath that coarse and preposterous canvas.</p>
<p id="id01393">Suddenly a light tap visited my shoulder. Starting,
turning, I met a face bent to encounter mine; a frowning, almost a
shocked face it was.</p>
<p id="id01394">"Que faites-vous ici?" said a voice.</p>
<p id="id01395">"Mais, Monsieur, je m'amuse."</p>
<p id="id01396">"Vous vous amusez! et &Atilde;&nbsp; quoi, s'il
vous plait? Mais d'abord, faites-moi le plaisir de vous lever;
prenez mon bras, et allons de l'autre
c&Atilde;&acute;t&Atilde;&copy;."</p>
<p id="id01397">I did precisely as I was bid. M. Paul Emanuel (it
was he) returned from Rome, and now a travelled man, was not likely
to be less tolerant of insubordination now, than before this added
distinction laurelled his temples.</p>
<p id="id01398">"Permit me to conduct you to your party," said he,
as we crossed the room.</p>
<p id="id01399">"I have no party."</p>
<p id="id01400">"You are not alone?"</p>
<p id="id01401">"Yes, Monsieur."</p>
<p id="id01402">"Did you come here unaccompanied?"</p>
<p id="id01403">"No, Monsieur. Dr. Bretton brought me here."</p>
<p id="id01404">"Dr. Bretton and Madame his mother, of course?"</p>
<p id="id01405">"No; only Dr. Bretton."</p>
<p id="id01406">"And he told you to look at <i>that</i>
picture?"</p>
<p id="id01407">"By no means; I found it out for myself."</p>
<p id="id01408">M. Paul's hair was shorn close as raven down, or I
think it would have bristled on his head. Beginning now to perceive
his drift, I had a certain pleasure in keeping cool, and working
him up.</p>
<p id="id01409">"Astounding insular audacity!" cried the Professor.
"Singuli&Atilde;&uml;res femmes que ces Anglaises!"</p>
<p id="id01410">"What is the matter, Monsieur?"</p>
<p id="id01411">"Matter! How dare you, a young person, sit coolly
down, with the self-possession of a gar&Atilde;&sect;on, and look
at <i>that</i> picture?"</p>
<p id="id01412">"It is a very ugly picture, but I cannot at all see
why I should not look at it."</p>
<p id="id01413">"Bon! bon! Speak no more of it. But you ought not
to be here alone."</p>
<p id="id01414">"If, however, I have no
society&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no <i>party</i>, as you say? And then,
what does it signify whether I am alone, or accompanied? nobody
meddles with me."</p>
<p id="id01415">"Taisez-vous, et asseyez-vous
l&Atilde;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;l&Atilde;&nbsp;!"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;setting
down a chair with emphasis in a particularly dull corner, before a
series of most specially dreary "cadres."</p>
<p id="id01416">"Mais, Monsieur?"</p>
<p id="id01417">"Mais, Mademoiselle, asseyez-vous, et ne bougez
pas&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;entendez-vous?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;jusqu'&Atilde;&nbsp;
ce qu'on vienne vous chercher, ou que je vous donne la
permission."</p>
<p id="id01418">"Quel triste coin!" cried I, "et quelles laids
tableaux!"</p>
<p id="id01419">And "laids," indeed, they were; being a set of
four, denominated in the catalogue "La vie d'une femme." They were
painted rather in a remarkable style&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;flat, dead,
pale, and formal. The first represented a "Jeune Fille," coming out
of a church-door, a missal in her hand, her dress very prim, her
eyes cast down, her mouth pursed up&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the image of
a most villanous little precocious she-hypocrite. The second, a
"Mari&Atilde;&copy;e," with a long white veil, kneeling at a
prie-dieu in her chamber, holding her hands plastered together,
finger to finger, and showing the whites of her eyes in a most
exasperating manner. The third, a "Jeune M&Atilde;&uml;re," hanging
disconsolate over a clayey and puffy baby with a face like an
unwholesome full moon. The fourth, a "Veuve," being a black woman,
holding by the hand a black little girl, and the twain studiously
surveying an elegant French monument, set up in a corner of some
P&Atilde;&uml;re la Chaise. All these four "Anges" were grim and
grey as burglars, and cold and vapid as ghosts. What women to live
with! insincere, ill-humoured, bloodless, brainless nonentities! As
bad in their way as the indolent gipsy-giantess, the Cleopatra, in
hers.</p>
<p id="id01420">It was impossible to keep one's attention long
confined to these master-pieces, and so, by degrees, I veered
round, and surveyed the gallery.</p>
<p id="id01421">A perfect crowd of spectators was by this time
gathered round the Lioness, from whose vicinage I had been
banished; nearly half this crowd were ladies, but M. Paul
afterwards told me, these were "des dames," and it was quite proper
for them to contemplate what no "demoiselle" ought to glance at. I
assured him plainly I could not agree in this doctrine, and did not
see the sense of it; whereupon, with his usual absolutism, he
merely requested my silence, and also, in the same breath,
denounced my mingled rashness and ignorance. A more despotic little
man than M. Paul never filled a professor's chair. I noticed, by
the way, that he looked at the picture himself quite at his ease,
and for a very long while: he did not, however, neglect to glance
from time to time my way, in order, I suppose, to make sure that I
was obeying orders, and not breaking bounds. By-and-by, he again
accosted me.</p>
<p id="id01422">"Had I not been ill?" he wished to know: "he
understood I had."</p>
<p id="id01423">"Yes, but I was now quite well."</p>
<p id="id01424">"Where had I spent the vacation?"</p>
<p id="id01425">"Chiefly in the Rue Fossette; partly with Madame
Bretton."</p>
<p id="id01426">"He had heard that I was left alone in the Rue
Fossette; was that so?"</p>
<p id="id01427">"Not quite alone: Marie Broc" (the
cr&Atilde;&copy;tin) "was with me."</p>
<p id="id01428">He shrugged his shoulders; varied and contradictory
expressions played rapidly over his countenance. Marie Broc was
well known to M. Paul; he never gave a lesson in the third division
(containing the least advanced pupils), that she did not occasion
in him a sharp conflict between antagonistic impressions. Her
personal appearance, her repulsive manners, her often unmanageable
disposition, irritated his temper, and inspired him with strong
antipathy; a feeling he was too apt to conceive when his taste was
offended or his will thwarted. On the other hand, her misfortunes,
constituted a strong claim on his forbearance and
compassion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such a claim as it was not in his
nature to deny; hence resulted almost daily drawn battles between
impatience and disgust on the one hand, pity and a sense of justice
on the other; in which, to his credit be it said, it was very
seldom that the former feelings prevailed: when they did, however,
M. Paul showed a phase of character which had its terrors. His
passions were strong, his aversions and attachments alike vivid;
the force he exerted in holding both in check by no means mitigated
an observer's sense of their vehemence. With such tendencies, it
may well be supposed he often excited in ordinary minds fear and
dislike; yet it was an error to fear him: nothing drove him so
nearly frantic as the tremor of an apprehensive and distrustful
spirit; nothing soothed him like confidence tempered with
gentleness. To evince these sentiments, however, required a
thorough comprehension of his nature; and his nature was of an
order rarely comprehended.</p>
<p id="id01429">"How did you get on with Marie Broc?" he asked,
after some minutes' silence.</p>
<p id="id01430">"Monsieur, I did my best; but it was terrible to be
alone with her!"</p>
<p id="id01431">"You have, then, a weak heart! You lack courage;
and, perhaps, charity.<br />
Yours are not the qualities which might constitute a Sister of
Mercy."<br /></p>
<p id="id01432">[He was a religious little man, in his way: the
self-denying and self-sacrificing part of the Catholic religion
commanded the homage of his soul.]</p>
<p id="id01433">"I don't know, indeed: I took as good care of her
as I could; but when her aunt came to fetch her away, it was a
great relief."</p>
<p id="id01434">"Ah! you are an egotist. There are women who have
nursed hospitals-full of similar unfortunates. You could not do
that?"</p>
<p id="id01435">"Could Monsieur do it himself?"</p>
<p id="id01436">"Women who are worthy the name ought infinitely to
surpass; our coarse, fallible, self-indulgent sex, in the power to
perform such duties."</p>
<p id="id01437">"I washed her, I kept her clean, I fed her, I tried
to amuse her; but she made mouths at me instead of speaking."</p>
<p id="id01438">"You think you did great things?"</p>
<p id="id01439">"No; but as great as I <i>could</i> do."</p>
<p id="id01440">"Then limited are your powers, for in tending one
idiot you fell sick."</p>
<p id="id01441">"Not with that, Monsieur; I had a nervous fever: my
mind was ill."</p>
<p id="id01442">"Vraiment! Vous valez peu de chose. You are not
cast in an heroic mould; your courage will not avail to sustain you
in solitude; it merely gives you the temerity to gaze with
sang-froid at pictures of Cleopatra."</p>
<p id="id01443">It would have been easy to show anger at the
teasing, hostile tone of the little man. I had never been angry
with him yet, however, and had no present disposition to begin.</p>
<p id="id01444">"Cleopatra!" I repeated, quietly. "Monsieur, too,
has been looking at<br />
Cleopatra; what does he think of her?"<br /></p>
<p id="id01445">"Cela ne vaut rien," he responded. "Une femme
superbe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;une taille d'imp&Atilde;&copy;ratrice,
des formes de Junon, mais une personne dont je ne voudrais ni pour
femme, ni pour fille, ni pour soeur. Aussi vous ne jeterez plus un
seul coup d'oeil de sa c&Atilde;&acute;t&Atilde;&copy;."</p>
<p id="id01446">"But I have looked at her a great many times while
Monsieur has been talking: I can see her quite well from this
corner."</p>
<p id="id01447">"Turn to the wall and study your four pictures of a
woman's life."</p>
<p id="id01448">"Excuse me, M. Paul; they are too hideous: but if
you admire them, allow me to vacate my seat and leave you to their
contemplation."</p>
<p id="id01449">"Mademoiselle," he said, grimacing a half-smile, or
what he intended for a smile, though it was but a grim and hurried
manifestation. "You nurslings of Protestantism astonish me. You
unguarded Englishwomen walk calmly amidst red-hot ploughshares and
escape burning. I believe, if some of you were thrown into
Nebuchadnezzar's hottest furnace you would issue forth untraversed
by the smell of fire."</p>
<p id="id01450">"Will Monsieur have the goodness to move an inch to
one side?"</p>
<p id="id01451">"How! At what are you gazing now? You are not
recognising an acquaintance amongst that group of jeunes gens?"</p>
<p id="id01452">"I think so&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Yes, I see there a
person I know."</p>
<p id="id01453">In fact, I had caught a glimpse of a head too
pretty to belong to any other than the redoubted Colonel de Hamal.
What a very finished, highly polished little pate it was! What a
figure, so trim and natty! What womanish feet and hands! How
daintily he held a glass to one of his optics! with what admiration
he gazed upon the Cleopatra! and then, how engagingly he tittered
and whispered a friend at his elbow! Oh, the man of sense! Oh, the
refined gentleman of superior taste and tact! I observed him for
about ten minutes, and perceived that he was exceedingly taken with
this dusk and portly Venus of the Nile. So much was I interested in
his bearing, so absorbed in divining his character by his looks and
movements, I temporarily forgot M. Paul; in the interim a group
came between that gentleman and me; or possibly his scruples might
have received another and worse shock from my present abstraction,
causing him to withdraw voluntarily: at any rate, when I again
looked round, he was gone.</p>
<p id="id01454">My eye, pursuant of the search, met not him, but
another and dissimilar figure, well seen amidst the crowd, for the
height as well as the port lent each its distinction. This way came
Dr. John, in visage, in shape, in hue, as unlike the dark, acerb,
and caustic little professor, as the fruit of the Hesperides might
be unlike the sloe in the wild thicket; as the high-couraged but
tractable Arabian is unlike the rude and stubborn "sheltie." He was
looking for me, but had not yet explored the corner where the
schoolmaster had just put me. I remained quiet; yet another minute
I would watch.</p>
<p id="id01455">He approached de Hamal; he paused near him; I
thought he had a pleasure in looking over his head; Dr. Bretton,
too, gazed on the Cleopatra. I doubt if it were to his taste: he
did not simper like the little Count; his mouth looked fastidious,
his eye cool; without demonstration he stepped aside, leaving room
for others to approach. I saw now that he was waiting, and, rising,
I joined him.</p>
<p id="id01456">We took one turn round the gallery; with Graham it
was very pleasant to take such a turn. I always liked dearly to
hear what he had to say about either pictures or books; because
without pretending to be a connoisseur, he always spoke his
thought, and that was sure to be fresh: very often it was also just
and pithy. It was pleasant also to tell him some things he did not
know&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he listened so kindly, so teachably;
unformalized by scruples lest so to bend his bright handsome head,
to gather a woman's rather obscure and stammering explanation,
should imperil the dignity of his manhood. And when he communicated
information in return, it was with a lucid intelligence that left
all his words clear graven on the memory; no explanation of his
giving, no fact of his narrating, did I ever forget.</p>
<p id="id01457">As we left the gallery, I asked him what he thought
of the Cleopatra (after making him laugh by telling him how
Professor Emanuel had sent me to the right about, and taking him to
see the sweet series of pictures recommended to my attention.)</p>
<p id="id01458">"Pooh!" said he. "My mother is a better-looking
woman. I heard some<br />
French fops, yonder, designating her as 'le type du voluptueux;' if
so,<br />
I can only say, 'le voluptueux' is little to my liking. Compare
that<br />
mulatto with Ginevra!"<br /></p>

<p id="id01461" style="margin-top: 2em">One morning, Mrs. Bretton,
coming promptly into my room, desired me to open my drawers and
show her my dresses; which I did, without a word.</p>
<p id="id01462">"That will do," said she, when she had turned them
over. "You must have a new one."</p>
<p id="id01463">She went out. She returned presently with a
dressmaker. She had me measured. "I mean," said she, "to follow my
own taste, and to have my own way in this little matter."</p>
<p id="id01464">Two days after came home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a pink
dress!</p>
<p id="id01465">"That is not for me," I said, hurriedly, feeling
that I would almost as soon clothe myself in the costume of a
Chinese lady of rank.</p>
<p id="id01466">"We shall see whether it is for you or not,"
rejoined my godmother, adding with her resistless decision: "Mark
my words. You will wear it this very evening."</p>
<p id="id01467">I thought I should not; I thought no human force
should avail to put me into it. A pink dress! I knew it not. It
knew not me. I had not proved it.</p>
<p id="id01468">My godmother went on to decree that I was to go
with her and Graham to a concert that same night: which concert,
she explained, was a grand affair to be held in the large salle, or
hall, of the principal musical society. The most advanced of the
pupils of the Conservatoire were to perform: it was to be followed
by a lottery "au b&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;fice des pauvres;"
and to crown all, the King, Queen, and Prince of Labassecour were
to be present. Graham, in sending tickets, had enjoined attention
to costume as a compliment due to royalty: he also recommended
punctual readiness by seven o'clock.</p>
<p id="id01469">About six, I was ushered upstairs. Without any
force at all, I found myself led and influenced by another's will,
unconsulted, unpersuaded, quietly overruled. In short, the pink
dress went on, softened by some drapery of black lace. I was
pronounced to be en grande tenue, and requested to look in the
glass. I did so with some fear and trembling; with more fear and
trembling, I turned away. Seven o'clock struck; Dr. Bretton was
come; my godmother and I went down. <i>She</i> was clad in brown
velvet; as I walked in her shadow, how I envied her those folds of
grave, dark majesty! Graham stood in the drawing-room doorway.</p>
<p id="id01470">"I <i>do</i> hope he will not think I have been
decking myself out to draw attention," was my uneasy
aspiration.</p>
<p id="id01471">"Here, Lucy, are some flowers," said he, giving me
a bouquet. He took no further notice of my dress than was conveyed
in a kind smile and satisfied nod, which calmed at once my sense of
shame and fear of ridicule. For the rest; the dress was made with
extreme simplicity, guiltless of flounce or furbelow; it was but
the light fabric and bright tint which scared me, and since Graham
found in it nothing absurd, my own eye consented soon to become
reconciled.</p>
<p id="id01472">I suppose people who go every night to places of
public amusement, can hardly enter into the fresh gala feeling with
which an opera or a concert is enjoyed by those for whom it is a
rarity: I am not sure that I expected great pleasure from the
concert, having but a very vague notion of its nature, but I liked
the drive there well. The snug comfort of the close carriage on a
cold though fine night, the pleasure of setting out with companions
so cheerful and friendly, the sight of the stars glinting fitfully
through the trees as we rolled along the avenue; then the freer
burst of the night-sky when we issued forth to the open
chauss&Atilde;&copy;e, the passage through the city gates, the
lights there burning, the guards there posted, the pretence of
inspection, to which we there submitted, and which amused us so
much&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all these small matters had for me, in
their novelty, a peculiarly exhilarating charm. How much of it lay
in the atmosphere of friendship diffused about me, I know not: Dr.
John and his mother were both in their finest mood, contending
animatedly with each other the whole way, and as frankly kind to me
as if I had been of their kin.</p>
<p id="id01473">Our way lay through some of the best streets of
Villette, streets brightly lit, and far more lively now than at
high noon. How brilliant seemed the shops! How glad, gay, and
abundant flowed the tide of life along the broad pavement! While I
looked, the thought of the Rue Fossette came across
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of the walled-in garden and school-house, and
of the dark, vast "classes," where, as at this very hour, it was my
wont to wander all solitary, gazing at the stars through the high,
blindless windows, and listening to the distant voice of the reader
in the refectory, monotonously exercised upon the "lecture pieuse."
Thus must I soon again listen and wander; and this shadow of the
future stole with timely sobriety across the radiant present.</p>
<p id="id01474">By this time we had got into a current of carriages
all tending in one direction, and soon the front of a great
illuminated building blazed before us. Of what I should see within
this building, I had, as before intimated, but an imperfect idea;
for no place of public entertainment had it ever been my lot to
enter yet.</p>
<p id="id01475">We alighted under a portico where there was a great
bustle and a great crowd, but I do not distinctly remember further
details, until I found myself mounting a majestic staircase wide
and easy of ascent, deeply and softly carpeted with crimson,
leading up to great doors closed solemnly, and whose panels were
also crimson-clothed.</p>
<p id="id01476">I hardly noticed by what magic these doors were
made to roll back&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr. John managed these points;
roll back they did, however, and within was disclosed a
hall&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;grand, wide, and high, whose sweeping
circular walls, and domed hollow ceiling, seemed to me all dead
gold (thus with nice art was it stained), relieved by cornicing,
fluting, and garlandry, either bright, like gold burnished, or
snow-white, like alabaster, or white and gold mingled in wreaths of
gilded leaves and spotless lilies: wherever drapery hung, wherever
carpets were spread, or cushions placed, the sole colour employed
was deep crimson. Pendent from the dome, flamed a mass that dazzled
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a mass, I thought, of rock-crystal, sparkling
with facets, streaming with drops, ablaze with stars, and
gorgeously tinged with dews of gems dissolved, or fragments of
rainbows shivered. It was only the chandelier, reader, but for me
it seemed the work of eastern genii: I almost looked to see if a
huge, dark, cloudy hand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that of the Slave of the
Lamp&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were not hovering in the lustrous and
perfumed atmosphere of the cupola, guarding its wondrous
treasure.</p>
<p id="id01477">We moved on&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I was not at all
conscious whither&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but at some turn we suddenly
encountered another party approaching from the opposite direction.
I just now see that group, as it flashed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;upon me
for one moment. A handsome middle-aged lady in dark velvet; a
gentleman who might be her son&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the best face,
the finest figure, I thought, I had ever seen; a third person in a
pink dress and black lace mantle.</p>
<p id="id01478">I noted them all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the third
person as well as the other two&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and for the
fraction of a moment believed them all strangers, thus receiving an
impartial impression of their appearance. But the impression was
hardly felt and not fixed, before the consciousness that I faced a
great mirror, filling a compartment between two pillars, dispelled
it: the party was our own party. Thus for the first, and perhaps
only time in my life, I enjoyed the "giftie" of seeing myself as
others see me. No need to dwell on the result. It brought a jar of
discord, a pang of regret; it was not flattering, yet, after all, I
ought to be thankful; it might have been worse.</p>
<p id="id01479">At last, we were seated in places commanding a good
general view of that vast and dazzling, but warm and cheerful hall.
Already it was filled, and filled with a splendid assemblage. I do
not know that the women were very beautiful, but their dresses were
so perfect; and foreigners, even such as are ungraceful in domestic
privacy, seem to posses the art of appearing graceful in public:
however blunt and boisterous those every-day and home movements
connected with peignoir and papillotes, there is a slide, a bend, a
carriage of the head and arms, a mien of the mouth and eyes, kept
nicely in reserve for gala use&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;always brought
out with the grande toilette, and duly put on with the
"parure."</p>
<p id="id01480">Some fine forms there were here and there, models
of a peculiar style of beauty; a style, I think, never seen in
England; a solid, firm-set, sculptural style. These shapes have no
angles: a caryatid in marble is almost as flexible; a Phidian
goddess is not more perfect in a certain still and stately sort.
They have such features as the Dutch painters give to their
madonnas: low-country classic features, regular but round, straight
but stolid; and for their depth of expressionless calm, of
passionless peace, a polar snow-field could alone offer a type.
Women of this order need no ornament, and they seldom wear any; the
smooth hair, closely braided, supplies a sufficient contrast to the
smoother cheek and brow; the dress cannot be too simple; the
rounded arm and perfect neck require neither bracelet nor
chain.</p>
<p id="id01481">With one of these beauties I once had the honour
and rapture to be perfectly acquainted: the inert force of the
deep, settled love she bore herself, was wonderful; it could only
be surpassed by her proud impotency to care for any other living
thing. Of blood, her cool veins conducted no flow; placid lymph
filled and almost obstructed her arteries.</p>
<p id="id01482">Such a Juno as I have described sat full in our
view&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sort of mark for all eyes, and quite
conscious that so she was, but proof to the magnetic influence of
gaze or glance: cold, rounded, blonde, and beauteous as the white
column, capitalled with gilding, which rose at her side.</p>
<p id="id01483">Observing that Dr. John's attention was much drawn
towards her, I entreated him in a low voice "for the love of heaven
to shield well his heart. You need not fall in love with
<i>that</i> lady," I said, "because, I tell you beforehand, you
might die at her feet, and she would not love you again."</p>
<p id="id01484">"Very well," said he, "and how do you know that the
spectacle of her grand insensibility might not with me be the
strongest stimulus to homage? The sting of desperation is, I think,
a wonderful irritant to my emotions: but" (shrugging his shoulders)
"you know nothing about these things; I'll address myself to my
mother. Mamma, I'm in a dangerous way."</p>
<p id="id01485">"As if that interested me!" said Mrs. Bretton.</p>
<p id="id01486">"Alas! the cruelty of my lot!" responded her son.
"Never man had a more unsentimental mother than mine: she never
seems to think that such a calamity can befall her as a
daughter-in-law."</p>
<p id="id01487">"If I don't, it is not for want of having that same
calamity held over my head: you have threatened me with it for the
last ten years. 'Mamma, I am going to be married soon!' was the cry
before you were well out of jackets."</p>
<p id="id01488">"But, mother, one of these days it will be
realized. All of a sudden, when you think you are most secure, I
shall go forth like Jacob or Esau, or any other patriarch, and take
me a wife: perhaps of these which are of the daughters of the
land."</p>
<p id="id01489">"At your peril, John Graham! that is all."</p>
<p id="id01490">"This mother of mine means me to be an old
bachelor. What a jealous old lady it is! But now just look at that
splendid creature in the pale blue satin dress, and hair of paler
brown, with 'reflets satin&Atilde;&copy;s' as those of her robe.
Would you not feel proud, mamma, if I were to bring that goddess
home some day, and introduce her to you as Mrs. Bretton,
junior?"</p>
<p id="id01491">"You will bring no goddess to La Terrasse: that
little ch&Atilde;&cent;teau will not contain two mistresses;
especially if the second be of the height, bulk, and circumference
of that mighty doll in wood and wax, and kid and satin."</p>
<p id="id01492">"Mamma, she would fill your blue chair so
admirably!"</p>
<p id="id01493">"Fill my chair? I defy the foreign usurper! a
rueful chair should it be for her: but hush, John Graham! Hold your
tongue, and use your eyes."</p>
<p id="id01494">During the above skirmish, the hall, which, I had
thought, seemed full at the entrance, continued to admit party
after party, until the semicircle before the stage presented one
dense mass of heads, sloping from floor to ceiling. The stage, too,
or rather the wide temporary platform, larger than any stage,
desert half an hour since, was now overflowing with life; round two
grand pianos, placed about the centre, a white flock of young
girls, the pupils of the Conservatoire, had noiselessly poured. I
had noticed their gathering, while Graham and his mother were
engaged in discussing the belle in blue satin, and had watched with
interest the process of arraying and marshalling them. Two
gentlemen, in each of whom I recognised an acquaintance, officered
this virgin troop. One, an artistic-looking man, bearded, and with
long hair, was a noted pianiste, and also the first music-teacher
in Villette; he attended twice a week at Madame Beck's pensionnat,
to give lessons to the few pupils whose parents were rich enough to
allow their daughters the privilege of his instructions; his name
was M. Josef Emanuel, and he was half-brother to M. Paul: which
potent personage was now visible in the person of the second
gentleman.</p>
<p id="id01495">M. Paul amused me; I smiled to myself as I watched
him, he seemed so thoroughly in his
element&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;standing conspicuous in presence of a
wide and grand assemblage, arranging, restraining, over-aweing
about one hundred young ladies. He was, too, so perfectly in
earnest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so energetic, so intent, and, above all,
so absolute: and yet what business had he there? What had he to do
with music or the Conservatoirehe who could hardly distinguish one
note from another? I knew that it was his love of display and
authority which had brought him there&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a love not
offensive, only because so naive. It presently became obvious that
his brother, M. Josef, was as much under his control as were the
girls themselves. Never was such a little hawk of a man as that M.
Paul! Ere long, some noted singers and musicians dawned upon the
platform: as these stars rose, the comet-like professor set.
Insufferable to him were all notorieties and celebrities: where he
could not outshine, he fled.</p>
<p id="id01496">And now all was prepared: but one compartment of
the hall waited to be filled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a compartment
covered with crimson, like the grand staircase and doors, furnished
with stuffed and cushioned benches, ranged on each side of two
regal chairs, placed solemnly under a canopy.</p>
<p id="id01497">A signal was given, the doors rolled back, the
assembly stood up, the orchestra burst out, and, to the welcome of
a choral burst, enter the King, the Queen, the Court of
Labassecour.</p>
<p id="id01498">Till then, I had never set eyes on living king or
queen; it may consequently be conjectured how I strained my powers
of vision to take in these specimens of European royalty. By
whomsoever majesty is beheld for the first time, there will always
be experienced a vague surprise bordering on disappointment, that
the same does not appear seated, en permanence, on a throne,
bonneted with a crown, and furnished, as to the hand, with a
sceptre. Looking out for a king and queen, and seeing only a
middle-aged soldier and a rather young lady, I felt half cheated,
half pleased.</p>
<p id="id01499">Well do I recall that King&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a man
of fifty, a little bowed, a little grey: there was no face in all
that assembly which resembled his. I had never read, never been
told anything of his nature or his habits; and at first the strong
hieroglyphics graven as with iron stylet on his brow, round his
eyes, beside his mouth, puzzled and baffled instinct. Ere long,
however, if I did not know, at least I felt, the meaning of those
characters written without hand. There sat a silent
sufferer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a nervous, melancholy man. Those eyes
had looked on the visits of a certain ghost&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had
long waited the comings and goings of that strangest spectre,
Hypochondria. Perhaps he saw her now on that stage, over against
him, amidst all that brilliant throng. Hypochondria has that wont,
to rise in the midst of thousands&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dark as Doom,
pale as Malady, and well-nigh strong as Death. Her comrade and
victim thinks to be happy one moment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Not so,"
says she; "I come." And she freezes the blood in his heart, and
beclouds the light in his eye.</p>
<p id="id01500">Some might say it was the foreign crown pressing
the King's brows which bent them to that peculiar and painful fold;
some might quote the effects of early bereavement. Something there
might be of both these; but these are embittered by that darkest
foe of humanity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;constitutional melancholy. The
Queen, his wife, knew this: it seemed to me, the reflection of her
husband's grief lay, a subduing shadow, on her own benignant face.
A mild, thoughtful, graceful woman that princess seemed; not
beautiful, not at all like the women of solid charms and marble
feelings described a page or two since. Hers was a somewhat slender
shape; her features, though distinguished enough, were too
suggestive of reigning dynasties and royal lines to give
unqualified pleasure. The expression clothing that profile was
agreeable in the present instance; but you could not avoid
connecting it with remembered effigies, where similar lines
appeared, under phase ignoble; feeble, or sensual, or cunning, as
the case might be. The Queen's eye, however, was her own; and pity,
goodness, sweet sympathy, blessed it with divinest light. She moved
no sovereign, but a lady&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;kind, loving, elegant.
Her little son, the Prince of Labassecour, and young Duc de
Dindonneau, accompanied her: he leaned on his mother's knee; and,
ever and anon, in the course of that evening, I saw her observant
of the monarch at her side, conscious of his beclouded abstraction,
and desirous to rouse him from it by drawing his attention to their
son. She often bent her head to listen to the boy's remarks, and
would then smilingly repeat them to his sire. The moody King
started, listened, smiled, but invariably relapsed as soon as his
good angel ceased speaking. Full mournful and significant was that
spectacle! Not the less so because, both for the aristocracy and
the honest bourgeoisie of Labassecour, its peculiarity seemed to be
wholly invisible: I could not discover that one soul present was
either struck or touched.</p>
<p id="id01501">With the King and Queen had entered their court,
comprising two or three foreign ambassadors; and with them came the
elite of the foreigners then resident in Villette. These took
possession of the crimson benches; the ladies were seated; most of
the men remained standing: their sable rank, lining the background,
looked like a dark foil to the splendour displayed in front. Nor
was this splendour without varying light and shade and gradation:
the middle distance was filled with matrons in velvets and satins,
in plumes and gems; the benches in the foreground, to the Queen's
right hand, seemed devoted exclusively to young girls, the
flower&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps, I should rather say, the
bud&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of Villette aristocracy. Here were no
jewels, no head-dresses, no velvet pile or silken sheen purity,
simplicity, and a&Atilde;&laquo;rial grace reigned in that virgin
band. Young heads simply braided, and fair forms (I was going to
write <i>sylph</i> forms, but that would have been quite untrue:
several of these "jeunes filles," who had not numbered more than
sixteen or seventeen years, boasted contours as robust and solid as
those of a stout Englishwoman of
five-and-twenty)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fair forms robed in white, or
pale rose, or placid blue, suggested thoughts of heaven and angels.
I knew a couple, at least, of these "rose et blanche" specimens of
humanity. Here was a pair of Madame Beck's late
pupils&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Mesdemoiselles Mathilde and
Ang&Atilde;&copy;lique: pupils who, during their last year at
school, ought to have been in the first class, but whose brains
never got them beyond the second division. In English, they had
been under my own charge, and hard work it was to get them to
translate rationally a page of <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. Also
during three months I had one of them for my vis-&Atilde;&nbsp;-vis
at table, and the quantity of household bread, butter, and stewed
fruit, she would habitually consume at "second
d&Atilde;&copy;jeuner" was a real world's
wonder&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to be exceeded only by the fact of her
actually pocketing slices she could not eat. Here be
truths&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wholesome truths, too.</p>
<p id="id01502">I knew another of these
seraphs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the prettiest, or, at any rate, the
least demure and hypocritical looking of the lot: she was seated by
the daughter of an English peer, also an honest, though
haughty-looking girl: both had entered in the suite of the British
embassy. She (<i>i.e.</i> my acquaintance) had a slight, pliant
figure, not at all like the forms of the foreign damsels: her hair,
too, was not close-braided, like a shell or a skull-cap of satin;
it looked <i>like</i> hair, and waved from her head, long, curled,
and flowing. She chatted away volubly, and seemed full of a
light-headed sort of satisfaction with herself and her position. I
did not look at Dr. Bretton; but I knew that he, too, saw Ginevra
Fanshawe: he had become so quiet, he answered so briefly his
mother's remarks, he so often suppressed a sigh. Why should he
sigh? He had confessed a taste for the pursuit of love under
difficulties; here was full gratification for that taste. His
lady-love beamed upon him from a sphere above his own: he could not
come near her; he was not certain that he could win from her a
look. I watched to see if she would so far favour him. Our seat was
not far from the crimson benches; we must inevitably be seen
thence, by eyes so quick and roving as Miss Fanshawe's, and very
soon those optics of hers were upon us: at least, upon Dr. and Mrs.
Bretton. I kept rather in the shade and out of sight, not wishing
to be immediately recognised: she looked quite steadily at Dr.
John, and then she raised a glass to examine his mother; a minute
or two afterwards she laughingly whispered her neighbour; upon the
performance commencing, her rambling attention was attracted to the
platform.</p>
<p id="id01503">On the concert I need not dwell; the reader would
not care to have my impressions thereanent: and, indeed, it would
not be worth while to record them, as they were the impressions of
an ignorance crasse. The young ladies of the Conservatoire, being
very much frightened, made rather a tremulous exhibition on the two
grand pianos. M. Josef Emanuel stood by them while they played; but
he had not the tact or influence of his kinsman, who, under similar
circumstances, would certainly have <i>compelled</i> pupils of his
to demean themselves with heroism and self-possession. M. Paul
would have placed the hysteric d&Atilde;&copy;butantes between two
fires&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;terror of the audience, and terror of
himself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and would have inspired them with the
courage of desperation, by making the latter terror incomparably
the greater: M. Josef could not do this.</p>
<p id="id01504">Following the white muslin pianistes, came a fine,
full-grown, sulky lady in white satin. She sang. Her singing just
affected me like the tricks of a conjuror: I wondered how she did
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how she made her voice run up and down, and
cut such marvellous capers; but a simple Scotch melody, played by a
rude street minstrel, has often moved me more deeply.</p>
<p id="id01505">Afterwards stepped forth a gentleman, who, bending
his body a good deal in the direction of the King and Queen, and
frequently approaching his white-gloved hand to the region of his
heart, vented a bitter outcry against a certain "fausse Isabelle."
I thought he seemed especially to solicit the Queen's sympathy;
but, unless I am egregiously mistaken, her Majesty lent her
attention rather with the calm of courtesy than the earnestness of
interest. This gentleman's state of mind was very harrowing, and I
was glad when he wound up his musical exposition of the same.</p>
<p id="id01506">Some rousing choruses struck me as the best part of
the evening's entertainment. There were present deputies from all
the best provincial choral societies; genuine, barrel-shaped,
native Labassecouriens. These worthies gave voice without mincing
the matter their hearty exertions had at least this good
result&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the ear drank thence a satisfying sense
of power.</p>
<p id="id01507">Through the whole
performance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;timid instrumental duets, conceited
vocal solos, sonorous, brass-lunged choruses&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my
attention gave but one eye and one ear to the stage, the other
being permanently retained in the service of Dr. Bretton: I could
not forget him, nor cease to question how he was feeling, what he
was thinking, whether he was amused or the contrary. At last he
spoke.</p>
<p id="id01508">"And how do you like it all, Lucy? You are very
quiet," he said, in his own cheerful tone.</p>
<p id="id01509">"I am quiet," I said, "because I am so very,
<i>very</i> much interested: not merely with the music, but with
everything about me."</p>
<p id="id01510">He then proceeded to make some further remarks,
with so much equanimity and composure that I began to think he had
really not seen what I had seen, and I
whispered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Miss Fanshawe is here: have you
noticed her?"</p>
<p id="id01511">"Oh, yes! and I observed that you noticed her
too?"</p>
<p id="id01512">"Is she come with Mrs. Cholmondeley, do you
think?"</p>
<p id="id01513">"Mrs. Cholmondeley is there with a very grand
party. Yes; Ginevra was in <i>her</i> train; and Mrs. Cholmondeley
was in Lady &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;'s train, who
was in the Queen's train. If this were not one of the compact
little minor European courts, whose very formalities are little
more imposing than familiarities, and whose gala grandeur is but
homeliness in Sunday array, it would sound all very fine."</p>
<p id="id01514">"Ginevra saw you, I think?"</p>
<p id="id01515">"So do I think so. I have had my eye on her several
times since you withdrew yours; and I have had the honour of
witnessing a little spectacle which you were spared."</p>
<p id="id01516">I did not ask what; I waited voluntary information,
which was presently given.</p>
<p id="id01517">"Miss Fanshawe," he said, "has a companion with
her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a lady of rank. I happen to know Lady Sara
by sight; her noble mother has called me in professionally. She is
a proud girl, but not in the least insolent, and I doubt whether
Ginevra will have gained ground in her estimation by making a butt
of her neighbours."</p>
<p id="id01518">"What neighbours?"</p>
<p id="id01519">"Merely myself and my mother. As to me it is all
very natural: nothing, I suppose, can be fairer game than the young
bourgeois doctor; but my mother! I never saw her ridiculed before.
Do you know, the curling lip, and sarcastically levelled glass thus
directed, gave me a most curious sensation?"</p>
<p id="id01520">"Think nothing of it, Dr. John: it is not worth
while. If Ginevra were in a giddy mood, as she is eminently
to-night, she would make no scruple of laughing at that mild,
pensive Queen, or that melancholy King. She is not actuated by
malevolence, but sheer, heedless folly. To a feather-brained
school-girl nothing is sacred."</p>
<p id="id01521">"But you forget: I have not been accustomed to look
on Miss Fanshawe in the light of a feather-brained school-girl. Was
she not my divinity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the angel of my career?"</p>
<p id="id01522">"Hem! There was your mistake."</p>
<p id="id01523">"To speak the honest truth, without any false rant
or assumed romance, there actually was a moment, six months ago,
when I thought her divine. Do you remember our conversation about
the presents? I was not quite open with you in discussing that
subject: the warmth with which you took it up amused me. By way of
having the full benefit of your lights, I allowed you to think me
more in the dark than I really was. It was that test of the
presents which first proved Ginevra mortal. Still her beauty
retained its fascination: three days&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;three hours
ago, I was very much her slave. As she passed me to-night,
triumphant in beauty, my emotions did her homage; but for one
luckless sneer, I should yet be the humblest of her servants. She
might have scoffed at <i>me</i>, and, while wounding, she would not
soon have alienated me: through myself, she could not in ten years
have done what, in a moment, she has done through my mother."</p>
<p id="id01524">He held his peace awhile. Never before had I seen
so much fire, and so little sunshine in Dr. John's blue eye as just
now.</p>
<p id="id01525">"Lucy," he recommenced, "look well at my mother,
and say, without fear or favour, in what light she now appears to
you."</p>
<p id="id01526">"As she always does&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an English,
middle-class gentlewoman; well, though gravely dressed, habitually
independent of pretence, constitutionally composed and
cheerful."</p>
<p id="id01527">"So she seems to me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bless her!
The merry may laugh <i>with</i> mamma, but the weak only will laugh
<i>at</i> her. She shall not be ridiculed, with my consent, at
least; nor without my&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my
scorn&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my
antipathy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01528">He stopped: and it was time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for
he was getting excited&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;more it seemed than the
occasion warranted. I did not then know that he had witnessed
double cause for dissatisfaction with Miss Fanshawe. The glow of
his complexion, the expansion of his nostril, the bold curve which
disdain gave his well-cut under lip, showed him in a new and
striking phase. Yet the rare passion of the constitutionally suave
and serene, is not a pleasant spectacle; nor did I like the sort of
vindictive thrill which passed through his strong young frame.</p>
<p id="id01529">"Do I frighten you, Lucy?" he asked.</p>
<p id="id01530">"I cannot tell why you are so very angry."</p>
<p id="id01531">"For this reason," he muttered in my ear. "Ginevra
is neither a pure angel, nor a pure-minded woman."</p>
<p id="id01532">"Nonsense! you exaggerate: she has no great harm in
her."</p>
<p id="id01533">"Too much for me. <i>I</i> can see where <i>you</i>
are blind. Now dismiss the subject. Let me amuse myself by teasing
mamma: I will assert that she is flagging. Mamma, pray rouse
yourself."</p>
<p id="id01534">"John, I will certainly rouse you if you are not
better conducted. Will you and Lucy be silent, that I may hear the
singing?"</p>
<p id="id01535">They were then thundering in a chorus, under cover
of which all the previous dialogue had taken place.</p>
<p id="id01536">"<i>You</i> hear the singing, mamma! Now, I will
wager my studs, which are genuine, against your paste
brooch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01537">"My paste brooch, Graham? Profane boy! you know
that it is a stone of value."</p>
<p id="id01538">"Oh! that is one of your superstitions: you were
cheated in the business."</p>
<p id="id01539">"I am cheated in fewer things than you imagine. How
do you happen to be acquainted with young ladies of the court,
John? I have observed two of them pay you no small attention during
the last half-hour."</p>
<p id="id01540">"I wish you would not observe them."</p>
<p id="id01541">"Why not? Because one of them satirically levels
her eyeglass at me? She is a pretty, silly girl: but are you
apprehensive that her titter will discomfit the old lady?"</p>
<p id="id01542">"The sensible, admirable old lady! Mother, you are
better to me than ten wives yet."</p>
<p id="id01543">"Don't be demonstrative, John, or I shall faint,
and you will have to carry me out; and if that burden were laid
upon you, you would reverse your last speech, and exclaim, 'Mother,
ten wives could hardly be worse to me than you are!'"</p>
<p id="id01544">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id01545">The concert over, the Lottery "au
b&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;fice des pauvres" came next: the
interval between was one of general relaxation, and the pleasantest
imaginable stir and commotion. The white flock was cleared from the
platform; a busy throng of gentlemen crowded it instead, making
arrangements for the drawing; and amongst
these&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the busiest of
all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;re-appeared that certain well-known form,
not tall but active, alive with the energy and movement of three
tall men. How M. Paul did work! How he issued directions, and, at
the same time, set his own shoulder to the wheel! Half-a-dozen
assistants were at his beck to remove the pianos, &amp;c.; no
matter, he must add to their strength his own. The redundancy of
his alertness was half-vexing, half-ludicrous: in my mind I both
disapproved and derided most of this fuss. Yet, in the midst of
prejudice and annoyance, I could not, while watching, avoid
perceiving a certain not disagreeable
na&Atilde;&macr;vet&Atilde;&copy; in all he did and said; nor could
I be blind to certain vigorous characteristics of his physiognomy,
rendered conspicuous now by the contrast with a throng of tamer
faces: the deep, intent keenness of his eye, the power of his
forehead, pale, broad, and full&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the mobility of
his most flexible mouth. He lacked the calm of force, but its
movement and its fire he signally possessed.</p>
<p id="id01546">Meantime the whole hall was in a stir; most people
rose and remained standing, for a change; some walked about, all
talked and laughed. The crimson compartment presented a peculiarly
animated scene. The long cloud of gentlemen, breaking into
fragments, mixed with the rainbow line of ladies; two or three
officer-like men approached the King and conversed with him. The
Queen, leaving her chair, glided along the rank of young ladies,
who all stood up as she passed; and to each in turn I saw her
vouchsafe some token of kindness&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a gracious
word, look or smile. To the two pretty English girls, Lady Sara and
Ginevra Fanshawe, she addressed several sentences; as she left
them, both, and especially the latter, seemed to glow all over with
gratification. They were afterwards accosted by several ladies, and
a little circle of gentlemen gathered round them; amongst
these&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the nearest to
Ginevra&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stood the Count de Hamal.</p>
<p id="id01547">"This room is stiflingly hot," said Dr. Bretton,
rising with sudden impatience.
"Lucy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;mother&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will you come a
moment to the fresh air?"</p>
<p id="id01548">"Go with him, Lucy," said Mrs. Bretton. "I would
rather keep my seat."</p>
<p id="id01549">Willingly would I have kept mine also, but Graham's
desire must take precedence of my own; I accompanied him.</p>
<p id="id01550">We found the night-air keen; or at least I did: he
did not seem to feel it; but it was very still, and the star-sown
sky spread cloudless. I was wrapped in a fur shawl. We took some
turns on the pavement; in passing under a lamp, Graham encountered
my eye.</p>
<p id="id01551">"You look pensive, Lucy: is it on my account?"</p>
<p id="id01552">"I was only fearing that you were grieved."</p>
<p id="id01553">"Not at all: so be of good
cheer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as I am. Whenever I die, Lucy, my
persuasion is that it will not be of heart-complaint. I may be
stung, I may seem to droop for a time, but no pain or malady of
sentiment has yet gone through my whole system. You have always
seen me cheerful at home?"</p>
<p id="id01554">"Generally."</p>
<p id="id01555">"I am glad she laughed at my mother. I would not
give the old lady for a dozen beauties. That sneer did me all the
good in the world. Thank you, Miss Fanshawe!" And he lifted his hat
from his waved locks, and made a mock reverence.</p>
<p id="id01556">"Yes," he said, "I thank her. She has made me feel
that nine parts in ten of my heart have always been sound as a
bell, and the tenth bled from a mere puncture: a lancet-prick that
will heal in a trice."</p>
<p id="id01557">"You are angry just now, heated and indignant; you
will think and feel differently to-morrow."</p>
<p id="id01558">"<i>I</i> heated and indignant! You don't know me.
On the contrary, the heat is gone: I am as cool as the
night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which, by the way, may be too cool for
you. We will go back."</p>
<p id="id01559">"Dr. John, this is a sudden change."</p>
<p id="id01560">"Not it: or if it be, there are good reasons for
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;two good reasons:<br />
I have told you one. But now let us re-enter."<br /></p>
<p id="id01561">We did not easily regain our seats; the lottery was
begun, and all was excited confusion; crowds blocked the sort of
corridor along which we had to pass: it was necessary to pause for
a time. Happening to glance round&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;indeed I half
fancied I heard my name pronounced&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I saw quite
near, the ubiquitous, the inevitable M. Paul. He was looking at me
gravely and intently: at me, or rather at my pink
dress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sardonic comment on which gleamed in his
eye. Now it was his habit to indulge in strictures on the dress,
both of the teachers and pupils, at Madame
Beck's&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a habit which the former, at least, held
to be an offensive impertinence: as yet I had not suffered from
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my sombre daily attire not being calculated
to attract notice. I was in no mood to permit any new encroachment
to-night: rather than accept his banter, I would ignore his
presence, and accordingly steadily turned my face to the sleeve of
Dr. John's coat; finding in that same black sleeve a prospect more
redolent of pleasure and comfort, more genial, more friendly, I
thought, than was offered by the dark little Professor's unlovely
visage. Dr. John seemed unconsciously to sanction the preference by
looking down and saying in his kind voice, "Ay, keep close to my
side, Lucy: these crowding burghers are no respecters of
persons."</p>
<p id="id01562">I could not, however, be true to myself. Yielding
to some influence, mesmeric or otherwise&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an
influence unwelcome, displeasing, but
effective&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I again glanced round to see if M.
Paul was gone. No, there he stood on the same spot, looking still,
but with a changed eye; he had penetrated my thought, and read my
wish to shun him. The mocking but not ill-humoured gaze was turned
to a swarthy frown, and when I bowed, with a view to conciliation,
I got only the stiffest and sternest of nods in return.</p>
<p id="id01563">"Whom have you made angry, Lucy?" whispered Dr.
Bretton, smiling. "Who is that savage-looking friend of yours?"</p>
<p id="id01564">"One of the professors at Madame Beck's: a very
cross little man."</p>
<p id="id01565">"He looks mighty cross just now: what have you done
to him? What is it all about? Ah, Lucy, Lucy! tell me the meaning
of this."</p>
<p id="id01566">"No mystery, I assure you. M. Emanuel is very
exigeant, and because I looked at your coat-sleeve, instead of
curtseying and dipping to him, he thinks I have failed in
respect."</p>
<p id="id01567">"The little&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;" began Dr. John: I
know not what more he would have added, for at that moment I was
nearly thrown down amongst the feet of the crowd. M. Paul had
rudely pushed past, and was elbowing his way with such utter
disregard to the convenience and security of all around, that a
very uncomfortable pressure was the consequence.</p>
<p id="id01568">"I think he is what he himself would call
'm&Atilde;&copy;chant,'" said Dr. Bretton.<br />
I thought so, too.<br /></p>
<p id="id01569">Slowly and with difficulty we made our way along
the passage, and at last regained our seats. The drawing of the
lottery lasted nearly an hour; it was an animating and amusing
scene; and as we each held tickets, we shared in the alternations
of hope and fear raised by each turn of the wheel. Two little
girls, of five and six years old, drew the numbers: and the prizes
were duly proclaimed from the platform. These prizes were numerous,
though of small value. It so fell out that Dr. John and I each
gained one: mine was a cigar-case, his a lady's
head-dress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a most airy sort of blue and silver
turban, with a streamer of plumage on one side, like a snowy cloud.
He was excessively anxious to make an exchange; but I could not be
brought to hear reason, and to this day I keep my cigar-case: it
serves, when I look at it, to remind me of old times, and one happy
evening.</p>
<p id="id01570">Dr. John, for his part, held his turban at arm's
length between his finger and thumb, and looked at it with a
mixture of reverence and embarrassment highly provocative of
laughter. The contemplation over, he was about coolly to deposit
the delicate fabric on the ground between his feet; he seemed to
have no shadow of an idea of the treatment or stowage it ought to
receive: if his mother had not come to the rescue, I think he would
finally have crushed it under his arm like an opera-hat; she
restored it to the band-box whence it had issued.</p>
<p id="id01571">Graham was quite cheerful all the evening, and his
cheerfulness seemed natural and unforced. His demeanour, his look,
is not easily described; there was something in it peculiar, and,
in its way, original. I read in it no common mastery of the
passions, and a fund of deep and healthy strength which, without
any exhausting effort, bore down Disappointment and extracted her
fang. His manner, now, reminded me of qualities I had noticed in
him when professionally engaged amongst the poor, the guilty, and
the suffering, in the Basse-Ville: he looked at once determined,
enduring, and sweet-tempered. Who could help liking him? <i>He</i>
betrayed no weakness which harassed all your feelings with
considerations as to how its faltering must be propped; from
<i>him</i> broke no irritability which startled calm and quenched
mirth; <i>his</i> lips let fall no caustic that burned to the bone;
<i>his</i> eye shot no morose shafts that went cold, and rusty, and
venomed through your heart: beside him was rest and
refuge&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;around him, fostering sunshine.</p>
<p id="id01572">And yet he had neither forgiven nor forgotten Miss
Fanshawe. Once angered, I doubt if Dr. Bretton were to be soon
propitiated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;once alienated, whether he were ever
to be reclaimed. He looked at her more than once; not stealthily or
humbly, but with a movement of hardy, open observation. De Hamal
was now a fixture beside her; Mrs. Cholmondeley sat near, and they
and she were wholly absorbed in the discourse, mirth, and
excitement, with which the crimson seats were as much astir as any
plebeian part of the hall. In the course of some apparently
animated discussion, Ginevra once or twice lifted her hand and arm;
a handsome bracelet gleamed upon the latter. I saw that its gleam
flickered in Dr. John's eye&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quickening therein a
derisive, ireful sparkle; he
laughed:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id01573">"I think," he said, "I will lay my turban on my
wonted altar of offerings; there, at any rate, it would be certain
to find favour: no grisette has a more facile faculty of
acceptance. Strange! for after all, I know she is a girl of
family."</p>
<p id="id01574">"But you don't know her education, Dr. John," said
I. "Tossed about all her life from one foreign school to another,
she may justly proffer the plea of ignorance in extenuation of most
of her faults. And then, from what she says, I believe her father
and mother were brought up much as she has been brought up."</p>
<p id="id01575">"I always understood she had no fortune; and once I
had pleasure in the thought," said he.</p>
<p id="id01576">"She tells me," I answered, "that they are poor at
home; she always speaks quite candidly on such points: you never
find her lying, as these foreigners will often lie. Her parents
have a large family: they occupy such a station and possess such
connections as, in their opinion, demand display; stringent
necessity of circumstances and inherent thoughtlessness of
disposition combined, have engendered reckless unscrupulousness as
to how they obtain the means of sustaining a good appearance. This
is the state of things, and the only state of things, she has seen
from childhood upwards."</p>
<p id="id01577">"I believe it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I thought to
mould her to something better: but, Lucy, to speak the plain truth,
I have felt a new thing to-night, in looking at her and de Hamal. I
felt it before noticing the impertinence directed at my mother. I
saw a look interchanged between them immediately after their
entrance, which threw a most unwelcome light on my mind."</p>
<p id="id01578">"How do you mean? You have been long aware of the
flirtation they keep up?"</p>
<p id="id01579">"Ay, flirtation! That might be an innocent girlish
wile to lure on the true lover; but what I refer to was not
flirtation: it was a look marking mutual and secret
understanding&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it was neither girlish nor
innocent. No woman, were she as beautiful as Aphrodite, who could
give or receive such a glance, shall ever be sought in marriage by
me: I would rather wed a paysanne in a short petticoat and high
cap&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and be sure that she was honest."</p>
<p id="id01580">I could not help smiling. I felt sure he now
exaggerated the case: Ginevra, I was certain, was honest enough,
with all her giddiness. I told him so. He shook his head, and said
he would not be the man to trust her with his honour.</p>
<p id="id01581">"The only thing," said I, "with which you may
safely trust her. She would unscrupulously damage a husband's purse
and property, recklessly try his patience and temper: I don't think
she would breathe, or let another breathe, on his honour."</p>
<p id="id01582">"You are becoming her advocate," said he. "Do you
wish me to resume my old chains?"</p>
<p id="id01583">"No: I am glad to see you free, and trust that free
you will long remain. Yet be, at the same time, just."</p>
<p id="id01584">"I am so: just as Rhadamanthus, Lucy. When once I
am thoroughly estranged, I cannot help being severe. But look! the
King and Queen are rising. I like that Queen: she has a sweet
countenance. Mamma, too, is excessively tired; we shall never get
the old lady home if we stay longer."</p>
<p id="id01585">"I tired, John?" cried Mrs. Bretton, looking at
least as animated and as wide-awake as her son. "I would undertake
to sit you out yet: leave us both here till morning, and we should
see which would look the most jaded by sunrise."</p>
<p id="id01586">"I should not like to try the experiment; for, in
truth, mamma, you are the most unfading of evergreens and the
freshest of matrons. It must then be on the plea of your son's
delicate nerves and fragile constitution that I found a petition
for our speedy adjournment."</p>
<p id="id01587">"Indolent young man! You wish you were in bed, no
doubt; and I suppose you must be humoured. There is Lucy, too,
looking quite done up. For shame, Lucy! At your age, a week of
evenings-out would not have made me a shade paler. Come away, both
of you; and you may laugh at the old lady as much as you please,
but, for my part, I shall take charge of the bandbox and
turban."</p>
<p id="id01588">Which she did accordingly. I offered to relieve
her, but was shaken off with kindly contempt: my godmother opined
that I had enough to do to take care of myself. Not standing on
ceremony now, in the midst of the gay "confusion worse confounded"
succeeding to the King and Queen's departure, Mrs. Bretton preceded
us, and promptly made us a lane through the crowd. Graham followed,
apostrophizing his mother as the most flourishing grisette it had
ever been his good fortune to see charged with carriage of a
bandbox; he also desired me to mark her affection for the sky-blue
turban, and announced his conviction that she intended one day to
wear it.</p>
<p id="id01589">The night was now very cold and very dark, but with
little delay we found the carriage. Soon we were packed in it, as
warm and as snug as at a fire-side; and the drive home was, I
think, still pleasanter than the drive to the concert. Pleasant it
was, even though the coachman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;having spent in
the shop of a "marchand de vin" a portion of the time we passed at
the concert&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;drove us along the dark and solitary
chauss&Atilde;&copy;e far past the turn leading down to La
Terrasse; we, who were occupied in talking and laughing, not
noticing the aberration till, at last, Mrs. Bretton intimated that,
though she had always thought the ch&Atilde;&cent;teau a retired
spot, she did not know it was situated at the world's end, as she
declared seemed now to be the case, for she believed we had been an
hour and a half en route, and had not yet taken the turn down the
avenue.</p>
<p id="id01590">Then Graham looked out, and perceiving only
dim-spread fields, with unfamiliar rows of pollards and limes
ranged along their else invisible sunk-fences, began to conjecture
how matters were, and calling a halt and descending, he mounted the
box and took the reins himself. Thanks to him, we arrived safe at
home about an hour and a half beyond our time.</p>
<p id="id01591">Martha had not forgotten us; a cheerful fire was
burning, and a neat supper spread in the dining-room: we were glad
of both. The winter dawn was actually breaking before we gained our
chambers. I took off my pink dress and lace mantle with happier
feelings than I had experienced in putting them on. Not all,
perhaps, who had shone brightly arrayed at that concert could say
the same; for not all had been satisfied with
friendship&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with its calm comfort and modest
hope.</p>
<h2 id="id01592" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h5 id="id01593">REACTION.</h5>
<p id="id01594" style="margin-top: 2em">Yet three days, and then I
must go back to the <i>pensionnat</i>. I almost numbered the
moments of these days upon the clock; fain would I have retarded
their flight; but they glided by while I watched them: they were
already gone while I yet feared their departure.</p>
<p id="id01595">"Lucy will not leave us to-day," said Mrs. Bretton,
coaxingly at breakfast; "she knows we can procure a second
respite."</p>
<p id="id01596">"I would not ask for one if I might have it for a
word," said I. "I long to get the good-by over, and to be settled
in the Rue Fossette again. I must go this morning: I must go
directly; my trunk is packed and corded."</p>
<p id="id01597">It appeared; however, that my going depended upon
Graham; he had said he would accompany, me, and it so fell out that
he was engaged all day, and only returned home at dusk. Then ensued
a little combat of words. Mrs. Bretton and her son pressed me to
remain one night more. I could have cried, so irritated and eager
was I to be gone. I longed to leave them as the criminal on the
scaffold longs for the axe to descend: that is, I wished the pang
over. How much I wished it, they could not tell. On these points,
mine was a state of mind out of their experience.</p>
<p id="id01598">It was dark when Dr. John handed me from the
carriage at Madame Beck's door. The lamp above was lit; it rained a
November drizzle, as it had rained all day: the lamplight gleamed
on the wet pavement. Just such a night was it as that on which, not
a year ago, I had first stopped at this very threshold; just
similar was the scene. I remembered the very shapes of the
paving-stones which I had noted with idle eye, while, with a
thick-beating heart, I waited the unclosing of that door at which I
stood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a solitary and a suppliant. On that night,
too, I had briefly met him who now stood with me. Had I ever
reminded him of that rencontre, or explained it? I had not, nor
ever felt the inclination to do so: it was a pleasant thought, laid
by in my own mind, and best kept there.</p>
<p id="id01599">Graham rung the bell. The door was instantly
opened, for it was just that period of the evening when the
half-boarders took their departure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;consequently,
Rosine was on the alert.</p>
<p id="id01600">"Don't come in," said I to him; but he stepped a
moment into the well-lighted vestibule. I had not wished him to see
that "the water stood in my eyes," for his was too kind a nature
ever to be needlessly shown such signs of sorrow. He always wished
to heal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to relieve&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when,
physician as he was, neither cure nor alleviation were, perhaps, in
his power.</p>
<p id="id01601">"Keep up your courage, Lucy. Think of my mother and
myself as true friends. We will not forget you."</p>
<p id="id01602">"Nor will I forget you, Dr. John."</p>
<p id="id01603">My trunk was now brought in. We had shaken hands;
he had turned to go, but he was not satisfied: he had not done or
said enough to content his generous impulses.</p>
<p id="id01604">"Lucy,"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stepping after
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"shall you feel very solitary here?"</p>
<p id="id01605">"At first I shall."</p>
<p id="id01606">"Well, my mother will soon call to see you; and,
meantime, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll
write&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;just any cheerful nonsense that comes into
my head&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shall I?"</p>
<p id="id01607">"Good, gallant heart!" thought I to myself; but I
shook my head, smiling, and said, "Never think of it: impose on
yourself no such task. <i>You</i> write to
<i>me</i>!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you'll not have time."</p>
<p id="id01608">"Oh! I will find or make time. Good-by!"</p>
<p id="id01609">He was gone. The heavy door crashed to: the axe had
fallen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the pang was experienced.</p>
<p id="id01610">Allowing myself no time to think or
feel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;swallowing tears as if they had been
wine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I passed to Madame's sitting-room to pay
the necessary visit of ceremony and respect. She received me with
perfectly well-acted cordiality&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was even
demonstrative, though brief, in her welcome. In ten minutes I was
dismissed. From the salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger I proceeded to the
refectory, where pupils and teachers were now assembled for evening
study: again I had a welcome, and one not, I think, quite hollow.
That over, I was free to repair to the dormitory.</p>
<p id="id01611">"And will Graham really write?" I questioned, as I
sank tired on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p id="id01612">Reason, coming stealthily up to me through the
twilight of that long, dim chamber, whispered
sedately&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"He may write once. So kind is his
nature, it may stimulate him for once to make the effort. But it
<i>cannot</i> be continued&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it <i>may</i> not be
repeated. Great were that folly which should build on such a
promise&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;insane that credulity which should
mistake the transitory rain-pool, holding in its hollow one
draught, for the perennial spring yielding the supply of
seasons."</p>
<p id="id01613">I bent my head: I sat thinking an hour longer.
Reason still whispered me, laying on my shoulder a withered hand,
and frostily touching my ear with the chill blue lips of eld.</p>
<p id="id01614">"If," muttered she, "if he <i>should</i> write,
what then? Do you meditate pleasure in replying? Ah, fool! I warn
you! Brief be your answer. Hope no delight of
heart&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no indulgence of intellect: grant no
expansion to feeling&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;give holiday to no single
faculty: dally with no friendly exchange: foster no genial
intercommunion&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."</p>
<p id="id01615">"But I have talked to Graham and you did not
chide," I pleaded.</p>
<p id="id01616">"No," said she, "I needed not. Talk for you is good
discipline. You converse imperfectly. While you speak, there can be
no oblivion of inferiority&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no encouragement to
delusion: pain, privation, penury stamp your
language&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."</p>
<p id="id01617">"But," I again broke in, "where the bodily presence
is weak and the speech contemptible, surely there cannot be error
in making written language the medium of better utterance than
faltering lips can achieve?"</p>
<p id="id01618">Reason only answered, "At your peril you cherish
that idea, or suffer its influence to animate any writing of
yours!"</p>
<p id="id01619">"But if I feel, may I <i>never</i> express?"</p>
<p id="id01620">"<i>Never!</i>" declared Reason.</p>
<p id="id01621">I groaned under her bitter sternness.
Never&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;never&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oh, hard word!
This hag, this Reason, would not let me look up, or smile, or hope:
she could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed,
broken-in, and broken-down. According to her, I was born only to
work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and
steadily through all life to despond. Reason might be right; yet no
wonder we are glad at times to defy her, to rush from under her rod
and give a truant hour to Imagination&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>her</i>
soft, bright foe, <i>our</i> sweet Help, our divine Hope. We shall
and must break bounds at intervals, despite the terrible revenge
that awaits our return. Reason is vindictive as a devil: for me she
was always envenomed as a step-mother. If I have obeyed her it has
chiefly been with the obedience of fear, not of love. Long ago I
should have died of her ill-usage her stint, her chill, her barren
board, her icy bed, her savage, ceaseless blows; but for that
kinder Power who holds my secret and sworn allegiance. Often has
Reason turned me out by night, in mid-winter, on cold snow,
flinging for sustenance the gnawed bone dogs had forsaken: sternly
has she vowed her stores held nothing more for
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;harshly denied my right to ask better
things&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. Then, looking up, have I seen in the
sky a head amidst circling stars, of which the midmost and the
brightest lent a ray sympathetic and attent. A spirit, softer and
better than Human Reason, has descended with quiet flight to the
waste&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bringing all round her a sphere of air
borrowed of eternal summer; bringing perfume of flowers which
cannot fade&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fragrance of trees whose fruit is
life; bringing breezes pure from a world whose day needs no sun to
lighten it. My hunger has this good angel appeased with food, sweet
and strange, gathered amongst gleaning angels, garnering their
dew-white harvest in the first fresh hour of a heavenly day;
tenderly has she assuaged the insufferable fears which weep away
life itself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;kindly given rest to deadly
weariness&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;generously lent hope and impulse to
paralyzed despair. Divine, compassionate, succourable influence!
When I bend the knee to other than God, it shall be at thy white
and winged feet, beautiful on mountain or on plain. Temples have
been reared to the Sun&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;altars dedicated to the
Moon. Oh, greater glory! To thee neither hands build, nor lips
consecrate: but hearts, through ages, are faithful to thy worship.
A dwelling thou hast, too wide for walls, too high for
dome&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a temple whose floors are
space&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rites whose mysteries transpire in
presence, to the kindling, the harmony of worlds!</p>
<p id="id01622">Sovereign complete! thou hadst, for endurance, thy
great army of martyrs; for achievement, thy chosen band of
worthies. Deity unquestioned, thine essence foils decay!</p>
<p id="id01623">This daughter of Heaven remembered me to-night; she
saw me weep, and she came with comfort: "Sleep," she said. "Sleep,
sweetly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I gild thy dreams!"</p>
<p id="id01624">She kept her word, and watched me through a night's
rest; but at dawn Reason relieved the guard. I awoke with a sort of
start; the rain was dashing against the panes, and the wind
uttering a peevish cry at intervals; the night-lamp was dying on
the black circular stand in the middle of the dormitory: day had
already broken. How I pity those whom mental pain stuns instead of
rousing! This morning the pang of waking snatched me out of bed
like a hand with a giant's gripe. How quickly I dressed in the cold
of the raw dawn! How deeply I drank of the ice-cold water in my
carafe! This was always my cordial, to which, like other
dram-drinkers, I had eager recourse when unsettled by chagrin.</p>
<p id="id01625">Ere long the bell rang its
<i>r&Atilde;&copy;veill&Atilde;&copy;e</i> to the whole school.
Being dressed, I descended alone to the refectory, where the stove
was lit and the air was warm; through the rest of the house it was
cold, with the nipping severity of a continental winter: though now
but the beginning of November, a north wind had thus early brought
a wintry blight over Europe: I remember the black stoves pleased me
little when I first came; but now I began to associate with them a
sense of comfort, and liked them, as in England we like a
fireside.</p>
<p id="id01626">Sitting down before this dark comforter, I
presently fell into a deep argument with myself on life and its
chances, on destiny and her decrees. My mind, calmer and stronger
now than last night, made for itself some imperious rules,
prohibiting under deadly penalties all weak retrospect of happiness
past; commanding a patient journeying through the wilderness of the
present, enjoining a reliance on faith&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
watching of the cloud and pillar which subdue while they guide, and
awe while they illumine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hushing the impulse to
fond idolatry, checking the longing out-look for a far-off promised
land whose rivers are, perhaps, never to be, reached save in dying
dreams, whose sweet pastures are to be viewed but from the desolate
and sepulchral summit of a Nebo.</p>
<p id="id01627">By degrees, a composite feeling of blended strength
and pain wound itself wirily round my heart, sustained, or at least
restrained, its throbbings, and made me fit for the day's work. I
lifted my head.</p>
<p id="id01628">As I said before, I was sitting near the stove, let
into the wall beneath the refectory and the carr&Atilde;&copy;, and
thus sufficing to heat both apartments. Piercing the same wall, and
close beside the stove, was a window, looking also into the
carr&Atilde;&copy;; as I looked up a cap-tassel, a brow, two eyes,
filled a pane of that window; the fixed gaze of those two eyes hit
right against my own glance: they were watching me. I had not till
that moment known that tears were on my cheek, but I felt them
now.</p>
<p id="id01629">This was a strange house, where no corner was
sacred from intrusion, where not a tear could be shed, nor a
thought pondered, but a spy was at hand to note and to divine. And
this new, this out-door, this male spy, what business had brought
him to the premises at this unwonted hour? What possible right had
he to intrude on me thus? No other professor would have dared to
cross the carr&Atilde;&copy; before the class-bell rang. M. Emanuel
took no account of hours nor of claims: there was some book of
reference in the first-class library which he had occasion to
consult; he had come to seek it: on his way he passed the
refectory. It was very much his habit to wear eyes before, behind,
and on each side of him: he had seen me through the little
window&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he now opened the refectory door, and
there he stood.</p>
<p id="id01630">"Mademoiselle, vous &Atilde;&ordf;tes triste."</p>
<p id="id01631">"Monsieur, j'en ai bien le droit."</p>
<p id="id01632">"Vous &Atilde;&ordf;tes malade de coeur et
d'humeur," he pursued. "You are at once mournful and mutinous. I
see on your cheek two tears which I know are hot as two sparks, and
salt as two crystals of the sea. While I speak you eye me
strangely. Shall I tell you of what I am reminded while watching
you?"</p>
<p id="id01633">"Monsieur, I shall be called away to prayers
shortly; my time for conversation is very scant and brief at this
hour&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;excuse&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01634">"I excuse everything," he interrupted; "my mood is
so meek, neither rebuff nor, perhaps, insult could ruffle it. You
remind me, then, of a young she wild creature, new caught, untamed,
viewing with a mixture of fire and fear the first entrance of the
breaker-in."</p>
<p id="id01635">Unwarrantable accost!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rash and
rude if addressed to a pupil; to a teacher inadmissible. He thought
to provoke a warm reply; I had seen him vex the passionate to
explosion before now. In me his malice should find no
gratification; I sat silent.</p>
<p id="id01636">"You look," said he, "like one who would snatch at
a draught of sweet poison, and spurn wholesome bitters with
disgust.</p>
<p id="id01637">"Indeed, I never liked bitters; nor do I believe
them wholesome. And to whatever is sweet, be it poison or food, you
cannot, at least, deny its own delicious
quality&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sweetness. Better, perhaps, to die
quickly a pleasant death, than drag on long a charmless life."</p>
<p id="id01638">"Yet," said he, "you should take your bitter dose
duly and daily, if I had the power to administer it; and, as to the
well-beloved poison, I would, perhaps, break the very cup which
held it."</p>
<p id="id01639">I sharply turned my head away, partly because his
presence utterly displeased me, and partly because I wished to shun
questions: lest, in my present mood, the effort of answering should
overmaster self-command.</p>
<p id="id01640">"Come," said he, more softly, "tell me the
truth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you grieve at being parted from
friends&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is it not so?"</p>
<p id="id01641">The insinuating softness was not more acceptable
than the inquisitorial curiosity. I was silent. He came into the
room, sat down on the bench about two yards from me, and persevered
long, and, for him, patiently, in attempts to draw me into
conversation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;attempts necessarily unavailing,
because I <i>could</i> not talk. At last I entreated to be let
alone. In uttering the request, my voice faltered, my head sank on
my arms and the table. I wept bitterly, though quietly. He sat a
while longer. I did not look up nor speak, till the closing door
and his retreating step told me that he was gone. These tears
proved a relief.</p>
<p id="id01642">I had time to bathe my eyes before breakfast, and I
suppose I appeared at that meal as serene as any other person: not,
however, quite as jocund-looking as the young lady who placed
herself in the seat opposite mine, fixed on me a pair of somewhat
small eyes twinkling gleefully, and frankly stretched across the
table a white hand to be shaken. Miss Fanshawe's travels, gaieties,
and flirtations agreed with her mightily; she had become quite
plump, her cheeks looked as round as apples. I had seen her last in
elegant evening attire. I don't know that she looked less charming
now in her school-dress, a kind of careless peignoir of a dark-blue
material, dimly and dingily plaided with black. I even think this
dusky wrapper gave her charms a triumph; enhancing by contrast the
fairness of her skin, the freshness of her bloom, the golden beauty
of her tresses.</p>
<p id="id01643">"I am glad you are come back, Timon," said she.
Timon was one of her dozen names for me. "You don't know how often
I have wanted you in this dismal hole."</p>
<p id="id01644">"Oh, have you? Then, of course, if you wanted me,
you have something for me to do: stockings to mend, perhaps." I
never gave Ginevra a minute's or a farthing's credit for
disinterestedness.</p>
<p id="id01645">"Crabbed and crusty as ever!" said she. "I expected
as much: it would not be you if you did not snub one. But now,
come, grand-mother, I hope you like coffee as much, and pistolets
as little as ever: are you disposed to barter?"</p>
<p id="id01646">"Take your own way."</p>
<p id="id01647">This way consisted in a habit she had of making me
convenient. She did not like the morning cup of coffee; its school
brewage not being strong or sweet enough to suit her palate; and
she had an excellent appetite, like any other healthy school-girl,
for the morning pistolets or rolls, which were new-baked and very
good, and of which a certain allowance was served to each. This
allowance being more than I needed, I gave half to Ginevra; never
varying in my preference, though many others used to covet the
superfluity; and she in return would sometimes give me a portion of
her coffee. This morning I was glad of the draught; hunger I had
none, and with thirst I was parched. I don't know why I chose to
give my bread rather to Ginevra than to another; nor why, if two
had to share the convenience of one drinking-vessel, as sometimes
happened&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for instance, when we took a long walk
into the country, and halted for refreshment at a
farm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I always contrived that she should be my
convive, and rather liked to let her take the lion's share, whether
of the white beer, the sweet wine, or the new milk: so it was,
however, and she knew it; and, therefore, while we wrangled daily,
we were never alienated.</p>
<p id="id01648">After breakfast my custom was to withdraw to the
first classe, and sit and read, or think (oftenest the latter)
there alone, till the nine-o'clock bell threw open all doors,
admitted the gathered rush of externes and demi-pensionnaires, and
gave the signal for entrance on that bustle and business to which,
till five P.M., there was no relax.</p>
<p id="id01649">I was just seated this morning, when a tap came to
the door.</p>
<p id="id01650">"Pardon, Mademoiselle," said a pensionnaire,
entering gently; and having taken from her desk some necessary book
or paper, she withdrew on tip-toe, murmuring as she passed me, "Que
mademoiselle est appliqu&Atilde;&copy;e!"</p>
<p id="id01651">Appliqu&Atilde;&copy;e, indeed! The means of
application were spread before me, but I was doing nothing; and had
done nothing, and meant to do nothing. Thus does the world give us
credit for merits we have not. Madame Beck herself deemed me a
regular bas-bleu, and often and solemnly used to warn me not to
study too much, lest "the blood should all go to my head." Indeed,
everybody in the Rue Fossette held a superstition that "Meess
Lucie" was learned; with the notable exception of M. Emanuel, who,
by means peculiar to himself, and quite inscrutable to me, had
obtained a not inaccurate inkling of my real qualifications, and
used to take quiet opportunities of chuckling in my ear his malign
glee over their scant measure. For my part, I never troubled myself
about this penury. I dearly like to think my own thoughts; I had
great pleasure in reading a few books, but not many: preferring
always those on whose style or sentiment the writer's individual
nature was plainly stamped; flagging inevitably over characterless
books, however clever and meritorious: perceiving well that, as far
as my own mind was concerned, God had limited its powers and, its
action&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;thankful, I trust, for the gift bestowed,
but unambitious of higher endowments, not restlessly eager after
higher culture.</p>
<p id="id01652">The polite pupil was scarcely gone, when,
unceremoniously, without tap, in burst a second intruder. Had I
been blind I should have known who this was. A constitutional
reserve of manner had by this time told with wholesome and, for me,
commodious effect, on the manners of my co-inmates; rarely did I
now suffer from rude or intrusive treatment. When I first came, it
would happen once and again that a blunt German would clap me on
the shoulder, and ask me to run a race; or a riotous
Labassecourienne seize me by the arm and drag me towards the
playground: urgent proposals to take a swing at the "Pas de
G&Atilde;&copy;ant," or to join in a certain romping hide-and-seek
game called "Un, deux, trois," were formerly also of hourly
occurrence; but all these little attentions had ceased some time
ago&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ceased, too, without my finding it necessary
to be at the trouble of point-blank cutting them short. I had now
no familiar demonstration to dread or endure, save from one
quarter; and as that was English I could bear it. Ginevra Fanshawe
made no scruple of&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at
times&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;catching me as I was crossing the
carr&Atilde;&copy;, whirling me round in a compulsory waltz, and
heartily enjoying the mental and physical discomfiture her
proceeding induced. Ginevra Fanshawe it was who now broke in upon
"my learned leisure." She carried a huge music-book under her
arm.</p>
<p id="id01653">"Go to your practising," said I to her at once:
"away with you to the little salon!"</p>
<p id="id01654">"Not till I have had a talk with you,
ch&Atilde;&uml;re amie. I know where you have been spending your
vacation, and how you have commenced sacrificing to the graces, and
enjoying life like any other belle. I saw you at the concert the
other night, dressed, actually, like anybody else. Who is your
tailleuse?"</p>
<p id="id01655">"Tittle-tattle: how prettily it begins! My
tailleuse!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a fiddlestick!<br />
Come, sheer off, Ginevra. I really don't want your
company."<br /></p>
<p id="id01656">"But when I want yours so much, ange farouche, what
does a little reluctance on your part signify? Dieu merci! we know
how to manoeuvre with our gifted compatriote&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
learned 'ourse Britannique.' And so, Ourson, you know Isidore?"</p>
<p id="id01657">"I know John Bretton."</p>
<p id="id01658">"Oh, hush!" (putting her fingers in her ears) "you
crack my tympanums with your rude Anglicisms. But, how is our
well-beloved John? Do tell me about him. The poor man must be in a
sad way. What did he say to my behaviour the other night? Wasn't I
cruel?"</p>
<p id="id01659">"Do you think I noticed you?"</p>
<p id="id01660">"It was a delightful evening. Oh, that divine de
Hamal! And then to watch the other sulking and dying in the
distance; and the old lady&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my future
mamma-in-law! But I am afraid I and Lady Sara were a little rude in
quizzing her."</p>
<p id="id01661">"Lady Sara never quizzed her at all; and for what
<i>you</i> did, don't make yourself in the least uneasy: Mrs.
Bretton will survive <i>your</i> sneer."</p>
<p id="id01662">"She may: old ladies are tough; but that poor son
of hers! Do tell me what he said: I saw he was terribly cut
up."</p>
<p id="id01663">"He said you looked as if at heart you were already
Madame de Hamal."</p>
<p id="id01664">"Did he?" she cried with delight. "He noticed that?
How charming! I thought he would be mad with jealousy?"</p>
<p id="id01665">"Ginevra, have you seriously done with Dr. Bretton?
Do you want him to give you up?"</p>
<p id="id01666">"Oh! you know he <i>can't</i> do that: but wasn't
he mad?"</p>
<p id="id01667">"Quite mad," I assented; "as mad as a March
hare."</p>
<p id="id01668">"Well, and how <i>ever</i> did you get him
home?"</p>
<p id="id01669">"How <i>ever</i>, indeed! Have you no pity on his
poor mother and me? Fancy us holding him tight down in the
carriage, and he raving between us, fit to drive everybody
delirious. The very coachman went wrong, somehow, and we lost our
way."</p>
<p id="id01670">"You don't say so? You are laughing at me. Now,
Lucy Snowe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id01671">"I assure you it is fact&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
fact, also, that Dr. Bretton would <i>not</i> stay in the carriage:
he broke from us, and <i>would</i> ride outside."</p>
<p id="id01672">"And afterwards?"</p>
<p id="id01673">"Afterwards&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when he <i>did</i>
reach home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the scene transcends
description."</p>
<p id="id01674">"Oh, but describe it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you know it
is such fun!"</p>
<p id="id01675">"Fun for <i>you</i>, Miss Fanshawe? but" (with
stern gravity) "you know the proverb&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;'What is
sport to one may be death to another.'"</p>
<p id="id01676">"Go on, there's a darling Timon."</p>
<p id="id01677">"Conscientiously, I cannot, unless you assure me
you have some heart."</p>
<p id="id01678">"I have&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such an immensity, you
don't know!"</p>
<p id="id01679">"Good! In that case, you will be able to conceive
Dr. Graham Bretton rejecting his supper in the first
instance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the chicken, the sweetbread prepared
for his refreshment, left on the table untouched.
Then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but it is of no use
dwelling at length on the harrowing details. Suffice it to say,
that never, in the most stormy fits and moments of his infancy, had
his mother such work to tuck the sheets about him as she had that
night."</p>
<p id="id01680">"He wouldn't lie still?"</p>
<p id="id01681">"He wouldn't lie still: there it was. The sheets
might be tucked in, but the thing was to keep them tucked in."</p>
<p id="id01682">"And what did he say?"</p>
<p id="id01683">"Say! Can't you imagine him demanding his divine
Ginevra, anathematizing that demon, de
Hamal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;raving about golden locks, blue eyes,
white arms, glittering bracelets?"</p>
<p id="id01684">"No, did he? He saw the bracelet?"</p>
<p id="id01685">"Saw the bracelet? Yes, as plain as I saw it: and,
perhaps, for the first time, he saw also the brand-mark with which
its pressure has encircled your arm. Ginevra" (rising, and changing
my tone), "come, we will have an end of this. Go away to your
practising."</p>
<p id="id01686">And I opened the door.</p>
<p id="id01687">"But you have not told me all."</p>
<p id="id01688">"You had better not wait until I <i>do</i> tell you
all. Such extra communicativeness could give you no pleasure.
March!"</p>
<p id="id01689">"Cross thing!" said she; but she obeyed: and,
indeed, the first classe was my territory, and she could not there
legally resist a notice of quittance from me.</p>
<p id="id01690">Yet, to speak the truth, never had I been less
dissatisfied with her than I was then. There was pleasure in
thinking of the contrast between the reality and my
description&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to remember Dr. John enjoying the
drive home, eating his supper with relish, and retiring to rest
with Christian composure. It was only when I saw him really unhappy
that I felt really vexed with the fair, frail cause of his
suffering.</p>
<p id="id01691">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id01692">A fortnight passed; I was getting once more inured
to the harness of school, and lapsing from the passionate pain of
change to the palsy of custom. One afternoon, in crossing the
carr&Atilde;&copy;, on my way to the first classe, where I was
expected to assist at a lesson of "style and literature," I saw,
standing by one of the long and large windows, Rosine, the
portress. Her attitude, as usual, was quite nonchalante. She always
"stood at ease;" one of her hands rested in her apron-pocket, the
other at this moment held to her eyes a letter, whereof
Mademoiselle coolly perused the address, and deliberately studied
the seal.</p>
<p id="id01693">A letter! The shape of a letter similar to that had
haunted my brain in its very core for seven days past. I had
dreamed of a letter last night. Strong magnetism drew me to that
letter now; yet, whether I should have ventured to demand of Rosine
so much as a glance at that white envelope, with the spot of red
wax in the middle, I know not. No; I think I should have sneaked
past in terror of a rebuff from Disappointment: my heart throbbed
now as if I already heard the tramp of her approach. Nervous
mistake! It was the rapid step of the Professor of Literature
measuring the corridor. I fled before him. Could I but be seated
quietly at my desk before his arrival, with the class under my
orders all in disciplined readiness, he would, perhaps, exempt me
from notice; but, if caught lingering in the carr&Atilde;&copy;, I
should be sure to come in for a special harangue. I had time to get
seated, to enforce perfect silence, to take out my work, and to
commence it amidst the profoundest and best trained hush, ere M.
Emanuel entered with his vehement burst of latch and panel, and his
deep, redundant bow, prophetic of choler.</p>
<p id="id01694">As usual he broke upon us like a clap of thunder;
but instead of flashing lightning-wise from the door to the
estrade, his career halted midway at my desk. Setting his face
towards me and the window, his back to the pupils and the room, he
gave me a look&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such a look as might have
licensed me to stand straight up and demand what he
meant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a look of scowling distrust.</p>
<p id="id01695">"Voil&Atilde;&nbsp;! pour vous," said he, drawing
his hand from his waist-coat, and placing on my desk a
letter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the very letter I had seen in Rosine's
hand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the letter whose face of enamelled white
and single Cyclop's-eye of vermilion-red had printed themselves so
clear and perfect on the retina of an inward vision. I knew it, I
felt it to be the letter of my hope, the fruition of my wish, the
release from my doubt, the ransom from my terror. This letter M.
Paul, with his unwarrantably interfering habits, had taken from the
portress, and now delivered it himself.</p>
<p id="id01696">I might have been angry, but had not a second for
the sensation. Yes: I held in my hand not a slight note, but an
envelope, which must, at least, contain a sheet: it felt not
flimsy, but firm, substantial, satisfying. And here was the
direction, "Miss Lucy Snowe," in a clean, clear, equal, decided
hand; and here was the seal, round, full, deftly dropped by
untremulous fingers, stamped with the well-cut impress of initials,
"J. G. B." I experienced a happy feeling&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a glad
emotion which went warm to my heart, and ran lively through all my
veins. For once a hope was realized. I held in my hand a morsel of
real solid joy: not a dream, not an image of the brain, not one of
those shadowy chances imagination pictures, and on which humanity
starves but cannot live; not a mess of that manna I drearily
eulogized awhile ago&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which, indeed, at first
melts on the lips with an unspeakable and preternatural sweetness,
but which, in the end, our souls full surely loathe; longing
deliriously for natural and earth-grown food, wildly praying
Heaven's Spirits to reclaim their own spirit-dew and
essence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an aliment divine, but for mortals
deadly. It was neither sweet hail nor small
coriander-seed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;neither slight wafer, nor
luscious honey, I had lighted on; it was the wild, savoury mess of
the hunter, nourishing and salubrious meat, forest-fed or
desert-reared, fresh, healthful, and life-sustaining. It was what
the old dying patriarch demanded of his son Esau, promising in
requital the blessing of his last breath. It was a godsend; and I
inwardly thanked the God who had vouchsafed it. Outwardly I only
thanked man, crying, "Thank you, thank you, Monsieur!"</p>
<p id="id01697">Monsieur curled his lip, gave me a vicious glance
of the eye, and strode to his estrade. M. Paul was not at all a
good little man, though he had good points.</p>
<p id="id01698">Did I read my letter there and then? Did I consume
the venison at once and with haste, as if Esau's shaft flew every
day?</p>
<p id="id01699">I knew better. The cover with its
address&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the seal, with its three clear
letters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was bounty and abundance for the
present. I stole from the room, I procured the key of the great
dormitory, which was kept locked by day. I went to my bureau; with
a sort of haste and trembling lest Madame should creep up-stairs
and spy me, I opened a drawer, unlocked a box, and took out a case,
and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;having feasted my eyes with one more look,
and approached the seal with a mixture of awe and shame and
delight, to my lips&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I folded the untasted
treasure, yet all fair and inviolate, in silver paper, committed it
to the case, shut up box and drawer, reclosed, relocked the
dormitory, and returned to class, feeling as if fairy tales were
true, and fairy gifts no dream. Strange, sweet insanity! And this
letter, the source of my joy, I had not yet read: did not yet know
the number of its lines.</p>
<p id="id01700">When I re-entered the schoolroom, behold M. Paul
raging like a pestilence! Some pupil had not spoken audibly or
distinctly enough to suit his ear and taste, and now she and others
were weeping, and he was raving from his estrade, almost livid.
Curious to mention, as I appeared, he fell on me.</p>
<p id="id01701">"Was I the mistress of these girls? Did I profess
to teach them the conduct befitting ladies?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
did I permit and, he doubted not, encourage them to strangle their
mother-tongue in their throats, to mince and mash it between their
teeth, as if they had some base cause to be ashamed of the words
they uttered? Was this modesty? He knew better. It was a vile
pseudo sentiment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the offspring or the forerunner
of evil. Rather than submit to this mopping and mowing, this
mincing and grimacing, this, grinding of a noble tongue, this
general affectation and sickening stubbornness of the pupils of the
first class, he would throw them up for a set of insupportable
petites ma&Atilde;&reg;tresses, and confine himself to teaching the
ABC to the babies of the third division."</p>
<p id="id01702">What could I say to all this? Really nothing; and I
hoped he would allow me to be silent. The storm recommenced.</p>
<p id="id01703">"Every answer to his queries was then refused? It
seemed to be considered in <i>that</i>
place&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that conceited boudoir of a first classe,
with its pretentious book-cases, its green-baized desks, its
rubbish of flower-stands, its trash of framed pictures and maps,
and its foreign surveillante, forsooth!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it
seemed to be the fashion to think <i>there</i> that the Professor
of Literature was not worthy of a reply! These were new ideas;
imported, he did not doubt, straight from 'la Grande Bretagne:'
they savoured of island insolence and arrogance."</p>
<p id="id01704">Lull the second&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the girls, not
one of whom was ever known to weep a tear for the rebukes of any
other master, now all melting like snow-statues before the
intemperate heat of M. Emanuel: I not yet much shaken, sitting
down, and venturing to resume my work.</p>
<p id="id01705">Something&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;either in my continued
silence or in the movement of my hand,
stitching&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;transported M. Emanuel beyond the last
boundary of patience; he actually sprang from his estrade. The
stove stood near my desk, he attacked it; the little iron door was
nearly dashed from its hinges, the fuel was made to fly.</p>
<p id="id01706">"Est-ce que vous avez l'intention de m'insulter?"
said he to me, in a low, furious voice, as he thus outraged, under
pretence of arranging the fire.</p>
<p id="id01707">It was time to soothe him a little if possible.</p>
<p id="id01708">"Mais, Monsieur," said I, "I would not insult you
for the world. I remember too well that you once said we should be
friends."</p>
<p id="id01709">I did not intend my voice to falter, but it did:
more, I think, through the agitation of late delight than in any
spasm of present fear. Still there certainly was something in M.
Paul's anger&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a kind of passion of
emotion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that specially tended to draw tears. I
was not unhappy, nor much afraid, yet I wept.</p>
<p id="id01710">"Allons, allons!" said he presently, looking round
and seeing the deluge universal. "Decidedly I am a monster and a
ruffian. I have only one pocket-handkerchief," he added, "but if I
had twenty, I would offer you each one. Your teacher shall be your
representative. Here, Miss Lucy."</p>
<p id="id01711">And he took forth and held out to me a clean silk
handkerchief. Now a person who did not know M. Paul, who was unused
to him and his impulses, would naturally have bungled at this
offer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;declined accepting the
same&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;et cetera. But I too plainly felt this
would never do: the slightest hesitation would have been fatal to
the incipient treaty of peace. I rose and met the handkerchief
half-way, received it with decorum, wiped therewith my eyes, and,
resuming my seat, and retaining the flag of truce in my hand and on
my lap, took especial care during the remainder of the lesson to
touch neither needle nor thimble, scissors nor muslin. Many a
jealous glance did M. Paul cast at these implements; he hated them
mortally, considering sewing a source of distraction from the
attention due to himself. A very eloquent lesson he gave, and very
kind and friendly was he to the close. Ere he had done, the clouds
were dispersed and the sun shining out&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;tears
were exchanged for smiles.</p>
<p id="id01712">In quitting the room he paused once more at my
desk.</p>
<p id="id01713">"And your letter?" said he, this time not quite
fiercely.</p>
<p id="id01714">"I have not yet read it, Monsieur."</p>
<p id="id01715">"Ah! it is too good to read at once; you save it,
as, when I was a boy,<br />
I used to save a peach whose bloom was very ripe?"<br /></p>
<p id="id01716">The guess came so near the truth, I could not
prevent a suddenly-rising warmth in my face from revealing as
much.</p>
<p id="id01717">"You promise yourself a pleasant moment," said he,
"in reading that letter; you will open it when
alone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;n'est-ce pas? Ah! a smile answers. Well,
well! one should not be too harsh; 'la jeunesse n'a qu'un
temps.'"</p>
<p id="id01718">"Monsieur, Monsieur!" I cried, or rather whispered
after him, as he turned to go, "do not leave me under a mistake.
This is merely a friend's letter. Without reading it, I can vouch
for that."</p>
<p id="id01719">"Je con&Atilde;&sect;ois, je con&Atilde;&sect;ois:
on sait ce que c'est qu'un ami. Bonjour,<br />
Mademoiselle!"<br /></p>
<p id="id01720">"But, Monsieur, here is your handkerchief."</p>
<p id="id01721">"Keep it, keep it, till the letter is read, then
bring it me; I shall read the billet's tenor in your eyes."</p>
<p id="id01722">When he was gone, the pupils having already poured
out of the schoolroom into the berceau, and thence into the garden
and court to take their customary recreation before the
five-o'clock dinner, I stood a moment thinking, and absently
twisting the handkerchief round my arm. For some
reason&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gladdened, I think, by a sudden return of
the golden glimmer of childhood, roused by an unwonted renewal of
its buoyancy, made merry by the liberty of the closing hour, and,
above all, solaced at heart by the joyous consciousness of that
treasure in the case, box, drawer up-stairs,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
fell to playing with the handkerchief as if it were a ball, casting
it into the air and catching it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as it fell. The
game was stopped by another hand than mine-a hand emerging from a
palet&Atilde;&acute;t-sleeve and stretched over my shoulder; it
caught the extemporised plaything and bore it away with these
sullen words:</p>
<p id="id01723">"Je vois bien que vous vous moquez de moi et de mes
effets."</p>
<p id="id01724">Really that little man was dreadful: a mere sprite
of caprice and, ubiquity: one never knew either his whim or his
whereabout.</p>
<h2 id="id01725" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h5 id="id01726">THE LETTER.</h5>
<p id="id01727" style="margin-top: 2em">When all was still in the
house; when dinner was over and the noisy recreation-hour past;
when darkness had set in, and the quiet lamp of study was lit in
the refectory; when the externes were gone home, the clashing door
and clamorous bell hushed for the evening; when Madame was safely
settled in the salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger in company with her
mother and some friends; I then glided to the kitchen, begged a
bougie for one half-hour for a particular occasion, found
acceptance of my petition at the hands of my friend Goton, who
answered, "Mais certainement, chou-chou, vous en aurez deux, si
vous voulez;" and, light in hand, I mounted noiseless to the
dormitory.</p>
<p id="id01728">Great was my chagrin to find in that apartment a
pupil gone to bed indisposed,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;greater when I
recognised, amid the muslin nightcap borders, the "figure
chiffonn&Atilde;&copy;e" of Mistress Ginevra Fanshawe; supine at
this moment, it is true&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but certain to wake and
overwhelm me with chatter when the interruption would be least
acceptable: indeed, as I watched her, a slight twinkling of the
eyelids warned me that the present appearance of repose might be
but a ruse, assumed to cover sly vigilance over "Timon's"
movements; she was not to be trusted. And I had so wished to be
alone, just to read my precious letter in peace.</p>
<p id="id01729">Well, I must go to the classes. Having sought and
found my prize in its casket, I descended. Ill-luck pursued me. The
classes were undergoing sweeping and purification by candle-light,
according to hebdomadal custom: benches were piled on desks, the
air was dim with dust, damp coffee-grounds (used by Labassecourien
housemaids instead of tea-leaves) darkened the floor; all was
hopeless confusion. Baffled, but not beaten, I withdrew, bent as
resolutely as ever on finding solitude <i>somewhere</i>.</p>
<p id="id01730">Taking a key whereof I knew the repository, I
mounted three staircases in succession, reached a dark, narrow,
silent landing, opened a worm-eaten door, and dived into the deep,
black, cold garret. Here none would follow
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;none interrupt&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not Madame
herself. I shut the garret-door; I placed my light on a doddered
and mouldy chest of drawers; I put on a shawl, for the air was
ice-cold; I took my letter; trembling with sweet impatience, I
broke its seal.</p>
<p id="id01731">"Will it be long&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will it be
short?" thought I, passing my hand across my eyes to dissipate the
silvery dimness of a suave, south-wind shower.</p>
<p id="id01732">It was long.</p>
<p id="id01733">"Will it be cool?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will it be
kind?"</p>
<p id="id01734">It was kind.</p>
<p id="id01735">To my checked, bridled, disciplined expectation, it
seemed very kind: to my longing and famished thought it seemed,
perhaps, kinder than it was.</p>
<p id="id01736">So little had I hoped, so much had I feared; there
was a fulness of delight in this taste of
fruition&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such, perhaps, as many a human being
passes through life without ever knowing. The poor English teacher
in the frosty garret, reading by a dim candle guttering in the
wintry air, a letter simply good-natured&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing
more; though that good-nature then seemed to me
godlike&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was happier than most queens in
palaces.</p>
<p id="id01737">Of course, happiness of such shallow origin could
be but brief; yet, while it lasted it was genuine and exquisite: a
bubble&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but a sweet bubble&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of
real honey-dew. Dr. John had written to me at length; he had
written to me with pleasure; he had written with benignant mood,
dwelling with sunny satisfaction on scenes that had passed before
his eyes and mine,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on places we had visited
together&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on conversations we had
held&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on all the little subject-matter, in short,
of the last few halcyon weeks. But the cordial core of the delight
was, a conviction the blithe, genial language generously imparted,
that it had been poured out not merely to content
<i>me</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but to gratify <i>himself</i>. A
gratification he might never more desire, never more
seek&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an hypothesis in every point of view
approaching the certain; but <i>that</i> concerned the future. This
present moment had no pain, no blot, no want; full, pure, perfect,
it deeply blessed me. A passing seraph seemed to have rested beside
me, leaned towards my heart, and reposed on its throb a softening,
cooling, healing, hallowing wing. Dr. John, you pained me
afterwards: forgiven be every ill&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;freely
forgiven&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for the sake of that one dear
remembered good!</p>
<p id="id01738">Are there wicked things, not human, which envy
human bliss? Are there evil influences haunting the air, and
poisoning it for man? What was near me?</p>
<p id="id01739">Something in that vast solitary garret sounded
strangely. Most surely and certainly I heard, as it seemed, a
stealthy foot on that floor: a sort of gliding out from the
direction of the black recess haunted by the malefactor cloaks. I
turned: my light was dim; the room was long&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but
as I live! I saw in the middle of that ghostly chamber a figure all
black and white; the skirts straight, narrow, black; the head
bandaged, veiled, white.</p>
<p id="id01740">Say what you will, reader&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;tell
me I was nervous or mad; affirm that I was unsettled by the
excitement of that letter; declare that I dreamed; this I
vow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I saw there&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in that
room&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on that night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an image
like&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a NUN.</p>
<p id="id01741">I cried out; I sickened. Had the shape approached
me I might have swooned. It receded: I made for the door. How I
descended all the stairs I know not. By instinct I shunned the
refectory, and shaped my course to Madame's sitting-room: I burst
in. I said&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id01742">"There is something in the grenier; I have been
there: I saw something.<br />
Go and look at it, all of you!"<br /></p>
<p id="id01743">I said, "All of you;" for the room seemed to me
full of people, though in truth there were but four present: Madame
Beck; her mother, Madame Kint, who was out of health, and now
staying with her on a visit; her brother, M. Victor Kint, and
another gentleman, who, when I entered the room, was conversing
with the old lady, and had his back towards the door.</p>
<p id="id01744">My mortal fear and faintness must have made me
deadly pale. I felt cold and shaking. They all rose in
consternation; they surrounded me. I urged them to go to the
grenier; the sight of the gentlemen did me good and gave me
courage: it seemed as if there were some help and hope, with men at
hand. I turned to the door, beckoning them to follow. They wanted
to stop me, but I said they must come this way: they must see what
I had seen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;-something strange, standing in the
middle of the garret. And, now, I remembered my letter, left on the
drawers with the light. This precious letter! Flesh or spirit must
be defied for its sake. I flew up-stairs, hastening the faster as I
knew I was followed: they were obliged to come.</p>
<p id="id01745">Lo! when I reached the garret-door, all within was
dark as a pit: the light was out. Happily some
one&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Madame, I think, with her usual calm
sense&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had brought a lamp from the room;
speedily, therefore, as they came up, a ray pierced the opaque
blackness. There stood the bougie quenched on the drawers; but
where was the letter? And I looked for <i>that</i> now, and not for
the nun.</p>
<p id="id01746">"My letter! my letter!" I panted and plained,
almost beside myself. I groped on the floor, wringing my hands
wildly. Cruel, cruel doom! To have my bit of comfort
preternaturally snatched from me, ere I had well tasted its
virtue!</p>
<p id="id01747">I don't know what the others were doing; I could
not watch them: they asked me questions I did not answer; they
ransacked all corners; they prattled about this and that
disarrangement of cloaks, a breach or crack in the
sky-light&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I know not what. "Something or
somebody has been here," was sagely averred.</p>
<p id="id01748">"Oh! they have taken my letter!" cried the
grovelling, groping, monomaniac.</p>
<p id="id01749">"What letter, Lucy? My dear girl, what letter?"
asked a known voice in my ear. Could I believe that ear? No: and I
looked up. Could I trust my eyes? Had I recognised the tone? Did I
now look on the face of the writer of that very letter? Was this
gentleman near me in this dim garret, John
Graham&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr. Bretton himself?</p>
<p id="id01750">Yes: it was. He had been called in that very
evening to prescribe for some access of illness in old Madame Kint;
he was the second gentleman present in the
salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger when I entered.</p>
<p id="id01751">"Was it <i>my</i> letter, Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id01752">"Your own: yours&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the letter you
wrote to me. I had come here to read it quietly. I could not find
another spot where it was possible to have it to myself. I had
saved it all day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;never opened it till this
evening: it was scarcely glanced over: I <i>cannot bear</i> to lose
it. Oh, my letter!"</p>
<p id="id01753">"Hush! don't cry and distress yourself so cruelly.
What is it worth? Hush! Come out of this cold room; they are going
to send for the police now to examine further: we need not stay
here&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;come, we will go down."</p>
<p id="id01754">A warm hand, taking my cold fingers, led me down to
a room where there was a fire. Dr. John and I sat before the stove.
He talked to me and soothed me with unutterable goodness, promising
me twenty letters for the one lost. If there are words and wrongs
like knives, whose deep-inflicted lacerations never
heal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;cutting injuries and insults of serrated
and poison-dripping edge&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so, too, there are
consolations of tone too fine for the ear not fondly and for ever
to retain their echo: caressing
kindnesses&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;loved, lingered over through a whole
life, recalled with unfaded tenderness, and answering the call with
undimmed shine, out of that raven cloud foreshadowing Death
himself. I have been told since that Dr. Bretton was not nearly so
perfect as I thought him: that his actual character lacked the
depth, height, compass, and endurance it possessed in my creed. I
don't know: he was as good to me as the well is to the parched
wayfarer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as the sun to the shivering jailbird. I
remember him heroic. Heroic at this moment will I hold him to
be.</p>
<p id="id01755">He asked me, smiling, why I cared for his letter so
very much. I thought, but did not say, that I prized it like the
blood in my veins. I only answered that I had so few letters to
care for.</p>
<p id="id01756">"I am sure you did not read it," said he; "or you
would think nothing of it!"</p>
<p id="id01757">"I read it, but only once. I want to read it again.
I am sorry it is lost." And I could not help weeping afresh.</p>
<p id="id01758">"Lucy, Lucy, my poor little god-sister (if there be
such a relationship), here&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>here</i> is your
letter. Why is it not better worth such tears, and such tenderly
exaggerating faith?"</p>
<p id="id01759">Curious, characteristic manoeuvre! His quick eye
had seen the letter on the floor where I sought it; his hand, as
quick, had snatched it up. He had hidden it in his waistcoat
pocket. If my trouble had wrought with a whit less stress and
reality, I doubt whether he would ever have acknowledged or
restored it. Tears of temperature one degree cooler than those I
shed would only have amused Dr. John.</p>
<p id="id01760">Pleasure at regaining made me forget merited
reproach for the teasing torment; my joy was great; it could not be
concealed: yet I think it broke out more in countenance than
language. I said little.</p>
<p id="id01761">"Are you satisfied now?" asked Dr. John.</p>
<p id="id01762">I replied that I was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;satisfied
and happy.</p>
<p id="id01763">"Well then," he proceeded, "how do you feel
physically? Are you growing calmer? Not much: for you tremble like
a leaf still."</p>
<p id="id01764">It seemed to me, however, that I was sufficiently
calm: at least I felt no longer terrified. I expressed myself
composed.</p>
<p id="id01765">"You are able, consequently, to tell me what you
saw? Your account was quite vague, do you know? You looked white as
the wall; but you only spoke of 'something,' not defining
<i>what</i>. Was it a man? Was it an animal? What was it?"</p>
<p id="id01766">"I never will tell exactly what I saw," said I,
"unless some one else sees it too, and then I will give
corroborative testimony; but otherwise, I shall be discredited and
accused of dreaming."</p>
<p id="id01767">"Tell me," said Dr. Bretton; "I will hear it in my
professional character: I look on you now from a professional point
of view, and I read, perhaps, all you would
conceal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in your eye, which is curiously vivid
and restless: in your cheek, which the blood has forsaken; in your
hand, which you cannot steady. Come, Lucy, speak and tell me."</p>
<p id="id01768">"You would laugh&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id01769">"If you don't tell me you shall have no more
letters."</p>
<p id="id01770">"You are laughing now."</p>
<p id="id01771">"I will again take away that single epistle: being
mine, I think I have a right to reclaim it."</p>
<p id="id01772">I felt raillery in his words: it made me grave and
quiet; but I folded up the letter and covered it from sight.</p>
<p id="id01773">"You may hide it, but I can possess it any moment I
choose. You don't know my skill in sleight of hand; I might
practise as a conjuror if I liked. Mamma says sometimes, too, that
I have a harmonizing property of tongue and eye; but you never saw
that in me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;did you, Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id01774">
"Indeed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;indeed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when you were
a mere boy I used to see both: far more then than
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for now you are strong, and strength
dispenses with subtlety. But still,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr. John,
you have what they call in this country 'un air fin,' that nobody
can, mistake. Madame Beck saw it, and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;-"</p>
<p id="id01775">"And liked it," said he, laughing, "because she has
it herself. But,<br />
Lucy, give me that letter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you don't really care
for it."<br /></p>
<p id="id01776">To this provocative speech I made no answer. Graham
in mirthful mood must not be humoured too far. Just now there was a
new sort of smile playing about his lips&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;very
sweet, but it grieved me somehow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a new sort of
light sparkling in his eyes: not hostile, but not reassuring. I
rose to go&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I bid him good-night a little
sadly.</p>
<p id="id01777">His sensitiveness&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that peculiar,
apprehensive, detective faculty of his&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;felt in a
moment the unspoken complaint&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the scarce-thought
reproach. He asked quietly if I was offended. I shook my head as
implying a negative.</p>
<p id="id01778">"Permit me, then, to speak a little seriously to
you before you go. You are in a highly nervous state. I feel sure
from what is apparent in your look and manner, however well
controlled, that whilst alone this evening in that dismal,
perishing sepulchral garret&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that dungeon under
the leads, smelling of damp and mould, rank with phthisis and
catarrh: a place you never ought to enter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
you saw, or <i>thought</i> you saw, some appearance peculiarly
calculated to impress the imagination. I know that you <i>are</i>
not, nor ever were, subject to material terrors, fears of robbers,
&amp;c.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am not so sure that a visitation,
bearing a spectral character, would not shake your very mind. Be
calm now. This is all a matter of the nerves, I see: but just
specify the vision."</p>
<p id="id01779">"You will tell nobody?"</p>
<p id="id01780">"Nobody&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;most certainly. You may
trust me as implicitly as you did P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas. Indeed,
the doctor is perhaps the safer confessor of the two, though he has
not grey hair."</p>
<p id="id01781">"You will not laugh?"</p>
<p id="id01782">"Perhaps I may, to do you good: but not in scorn.
Lucy, I feel as a friend towards you, though your timid nature is
slow to trust."</p>
<p id="id01783">He now looked like a friend: that indescribable
smile and sparkle were gone; those formidable arched curves of lip,
nostril, eyebrow, were depressed; repose marked his
attitude&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;attention sobered his aspect. Won to
confidence, I told him exactly what I had seen: ere now I had
narrated to him the legend of the house&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whiling
away with that narrative an hour of a certain mild October
afternoon, when he and I rode through Bois l'Etang.</p>
<p id="id01784">He sat and thought, and while he thought, we heard
them all coming down-stairs.</p>
<p id="id01785">"Are they going to interrupt?" said he, glancing at
the door with an annoyed expression.</p>
<p id="id01786">"They will not come here," I answered; for we were
in the little salon where Madame never sat in the evening, and
where it was by mere chance that heat was still lingering in the
stove. They passed the door and went on to the
salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger.</p>
<p id="id01787">"Now," he pursued, "they will talk about thieves,
burglars, and so on: let them do so&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;mind you say
nothing, and keep your resolution of describing your nun to nobody.
She may appear to you again: don't start."</p>
<p id="id01788">"You think then," I said, with secret horror, "she
came out of my brain, and is now gone in there, and may glide out
again at an hour and a day when I look not for her?"</p>
<p id="id01789">"I think it a case of spectral illusion: I fear,
following on and resulting from long-continued mental
conflict."</p>
<p id="id01790">"Oh, Doctor John&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I shudder at
the thought of being liable to such an illusion! It seemed so real.
Is there no cure?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no preventive?"</p>
<p id="id01791">"Happiness is the cure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
cheerful mind the preventive: cultivate both."</p>
<p id="id01792">No mockery in this world ever sounds to me so
hollow as that of being told to <i>cultivate</i> happiness. What
does such advice mean? Happiness is not a potato, to be planted in
mould, and tilled with manure. Happiness is a glory shining far
down upon us out of Heaven. She is a divine dew which the soul, on
certain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the
amaranth bloom and golden fruitage of Paradise.</p>
<p id="id01793">"Cultivate happiness!" I said briefly to the
doctor: "do <i>you</i> cultivate happiness? How do you manage?"</p>
<p id="id01794">"I am a cheerful fellow by nature: and then
ill-luck has never dogged me. Adversity gave me and my mother one
passing scowl and brush, but we defied her, or rather laughed at
her, and she went by.".</p>
<p id="id01795">"There is no cultivation in all this."</p>
<p id="id01796">"I do not give way to melancholy."</p>
<p id="id01797">"Yes: I have seen you subdued by that feeling."</p>
<p id="id01798">"About Ginevra Fanshawe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;eh?"</p>
<p id="id01799">"Did she not sometimes make you miserable?"</p>
<p id="id01800">"Pooh! stuff! nonsense! You see I am better
now."</p>
<p id="id01801">If a laughing eye with a lively light, and a face
bright with beaming and healthy energy, could attest that he was
better, better he certainly was.</p>
<p id="id01802">"You do not look much amiss, or greatly out of
condition," I allowed.</p>
<p id="id01803">"And why, Lucy, can't you look and feel as I
do&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;buoyant, courageous, and fit to defy all the
nuns and flirts in Christendom? I would give gold on the spot just
to see you snap your fingers. Try the manoeuvre."</p>
<p id="id01804">"If I were to bring Miss Fanshawe into your
presence just now?"</p>
<p id="id01805">"I vow, Lucy, she should not move me: or, she
should move me but by one thing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;true, yes, and
passionate love. I would accord forgiveness at no less a
price."</p>
<p id="id01806">"Indeed! a smile of hers would have been a fortune
to you a while since."</p>
<p id="id01807">"Transformed, Lucy: transformed! Remember, you once
called me a slave! but I am a free man now!"</p>
<p id="id01808">He stood up: in the port of his head, the carriage
of his figure, in his beaming eye and mien, there revealed itself a
liberty which was more than ease&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a mood which
was disdain of his past bondage.</p>
<p id="id01809">"Miss Fanshawe," he pursued, "has led me through a
phase of feeling which is over: I have entered another condition,
and am now much disposed to exact love for
love&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;passion for passion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
good measure of it, too."</p>
<p id="id01810">"Ah, Doctor! Doctor! you said it was your nature to
pursue Love under difficulties&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to be charmed by
a proud insensibility!".</p>
<p id="id01811">He laughed, and answered, "My nature varies: the
mood of one hour is sometimes the mockery of the next. Well, Lucy"
(drawing on his gloves), "will the Nun come again to-night, think
you?"</p>
<p id="id01812">"I don't think she will."</p>
<p id="id01813">"Give her my compliments, if she
does&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr. John's
compliments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and entreat her to have the goodness
to wait a visit from him. Lucy, was she a pretty nun? Had she a
pretty face? You have not told me that yet; and <i>that</i> is the
really important point."</p>
<p id="id01814">"She had a white cloth over her face," said I, "but
her eyes glittered."</p>
<p id="id01815">"Confusion to her goblin trappings!" cried he,
irreverently: "but at least she had handsome
eyes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bright and soft."</p>
<p id="id01816">"Cold and fixed," was the reply.</p>
<p id="id01817">"No, no, we'll none of her: she shall not haunt
you, Lucy. Give her that shake of the hand, if she comes again.
Will she stand <i>that</i>, do you think?"</p>
<p id="id01818">I thought it too kind and cordial for a ghost to
stand: and so was the smile which matched it, and accompanied his
"Good-night."</p>
<p id="id01819">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id01820">And had there been anything in the garret? What did
they discover? I believe, on the closest examination, their
discoveries amounted to very little. They talked, at first, of the
cloaks being disturbed; but Madame Beck told me afterwards she
thought they hung much as usual: and as for the broken pane in the
skylight, she affirmed that aperture was rarely without one or more
panes broken or cracked: and besides, a heavy hail-storm had fallen
a few days ago. Madame questioned me very closely as to what I had
seen, but I only described an obscure figure clothed in black: I
took care not to breathe the word "nun," certain that this word
would at once suggest to her mind an idea of romance and unreality.
She charged me to say nothing on the subject to any servant, pupil,
or teacher, and highly commended my discretion in coming to her
private salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger, instead of carrying the tale
of horror to the school refectory. Thus the subject dropped. I was
left secretly and sadly to wonder, in my own mind, whether that
strange thing was of this world, or of a realm beyond the grave; or
whether indeed it was only the child of malady, and I of that
malady the prey.</p>
<h2 id="id01821" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h5 id="id01822">VASHTI.</h5>
<p id="id01823" style="margin-top: 2em">To wonder sadly, did I say?
No: a new influence began to act upon my life, and sadness, for a
certain space, was held at bay. Conceive a dell, deep-hollowed in
forest secresy; it lies in dimness and mist: its turf is dank, its
herbage pale and humid. A storm or an axe makes a wide gap amongst
the oak-trees; the breeze sweeps in; the sun looks down; the sad,
cold dell becomes a deep cup of lustre; high summer pours her blue
glory and her golden light out of that beauteous sky, which till
now the starved hollow never saw.</p>
<p id="id01824">A new creed became mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a belief
in happiness.</p>
<p id="id01825">It was three weeks since the adventure of the
garret, and I possessed in that case, box, drawer up-stairs,
casketed with that first letter, four companions like to it, traced
by the same firm pen, sealed with the same clear seal, full of the
same vital comfort. Vital comfort it seemed to me then: I read them
in after years; they were kind letters
enough&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pleasing letters, because composed by one
well pleased; in the two last there were three or four closing
lines half-gay, half-tender, "by <i>feeling</i> touched, but not
subdued." Time, dear reader, mellowed them to a beverage of this
mild quality; but when I first tasted their elixir, fresh from the
fount so honoured, it seemed juice of a divine vintage: a draught
which Hebe might fill, and the very gods approve.</p>
<p id="id01826">Does the reader, remembering what was said some
pages back, care to ask how I answered these letters: whether under
the dry, stinting check of Reason, or according to the full,
liberal impulse of Feeling?</p>
<p id="id01827">To speak truth, I compromised matters; I served two
masters: I bowed down in the houses of Rimmon, and lifted the heart
at another shrine. I wrote to these letters two
answers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one for my own relief, the other for
Graham's perusal.</p>
<p id="id01828">To begin with: Feeling and I turned Reason out of
doors, drew against her bar and bolt, then we sat down, spread our
paper, dipped in the ink an eager pen, and, with deep enjoyment,
poured out our sincere heart. When we had
done&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when two sheets were covered with the
language of a strongly-adherent affection, a rooted and active
gratitude&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;(once, for all, in this parenthesis, I
disclaim, with the utmost scorn, every sneaking suspicion of what
are called "warmer feelings:" women do not entertain these "warmer
feelings" where, from the commencement, through the whole progress
of an acquaintance, they have never once been cheated of the
conviction that, to do so would be to commit a mortal absurdity:
nobody ever launches into Love unless he has seen or dreamed the
rising of Hope's star over Love's troubled
waters)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when, then, I had given expression to a
closely-clinging and deeply-honouring
attachment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an attachment that wanted to attract
to itself and take to its own lot all that was painful in the
destiny of its object; that would, if it could, have absorbed and
conducted away all storms and lightnings from an existence viewed
with a passion of solicitude&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;then, just at that
moment, the doors of my heart would shake, bolt and bar would
yield, Reason would leap in vigorous and revengeful, snatch the
full sheets, read, sneer, erase, tear up, re-write, fold, seal,
direct, and send a terse, curt missive of a page. She did
right.</p>
<p id="id01829">I did not live on letters only: I was visited, I
was looked after; once a week I was taken out to La Terrasse;
always I was made much of. Dr. Bretton failed not to tell me
<i>why</i> he was so kind: "To keep away the nun," he said; "he was
determined to dispute with her her prey. He had taken," he
declared, "a thorough dislike to her, chiefly on account of that
white face-cloth, and those cold grey eyes: the moment he heard of
those odious particulars," he affirmed, "consummate disgust had
incited him to oppose her; he was determined to try whether he or
she was the cleverest, and he only wished she would once more look
in upon me when he was present:" but <i>that</i> she never did. In
short, he regarded me scientifically in the light of a patient, and
at once exercised his professional skill, and gratified his natural
benevolence, by a course of cordial and attentive treatment.</p>
<p id="id01830">One evening, the first in December, I was walking
by myself in the carr&Atilde;&copy;; it was six o'clock; the
classe-doors were closed; but within, the pupils, rampant in the
licence of evening recreation, were counterfeiting a miniature
chaos. The carr&Atilde;&copy; was quite dark, except a red light
shining under and about the stove; the wide glass-doors and the
long windows were frosted over; a crystal sparkle of starlight,
here and there spangling this blanched winter veil, and breaking
with scattered brilliance the paleness of its embroidery, proved it
a clear night, though moonless. That I should dare to remain thus
alone in darkness, showed that my nerves were regaining a healthy
tone: I thought of the nun, but hardly feared her; though the
staircase was behind me, leading up, through blind, black night,
from landing to landing, to the haunted grenier. Yet I own my heart
quaked, my pulse leaped, when I suddenly heard breathing and
rustling, and turning, saw in the deep shadow of the steps a deeper
shadow still&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a shape that moved and descended.
It paused a while at the classe-door, and then it glided before me.
Simultaneously came a clangor of the distant door-bell. Life-like
sounds bring life-like feelings: this shape was too round and low
for my gaunt nun: it was only Madame Beck on duty.</p>
<p id="id01831">"Mademoiselle Lucy!" cried Rosine, bursting in,
lamp in hand, from the corridor, "on est l&Atilde;&nbsp; pour vous
au salon."</p>
<p id="id01832">Madame saw me, I saw Madame, Rosine saw us both:
there was no mutual recognition. I made straight for the salon.
There I found what I own I anticipated I should
find&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dr. Bretton; but he was in
evening-dress.</p>
<p id="id01833">"The carriage is at the door," said he; "my mother
has sent it to take you to the theatre; she was going herself, but
an arrival has prevented her: she immediately said, 'Take Lucy in
my place.' Will you go?"</p>
<p id="id01834">"Just now? I am not dressed," cried I, glancing
despairingly at my dark merino.</p>
<p id="id01835">"You have half an hour to dress. I should have
given you notice, but I only determined on going since five
o'clock, when I heard there was to be a genuine regale in the
presence of a great actress."</p>
<p id="id01836">And he mentioned a name that thrilled
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a name that, in those days, could thrill
Europe. It is hushed now: its once restless echoes are all still;
she who bore it went years ago to her rest: night and oblivion long
since closed above her; but <i>then</i> her
day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a day of Sirius&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stood at
its full height, light and fervour.</p>
<p id="id01837">"I'll go; I will be ready in ten minutes," I vowed.
And away I flew, never once checked, reader, by the thought which
perhaps at this moment checks you: namely, that to go anywhere with
Graham and without Mrs. Bretton could be objectionable. I could not
have conceived, much less have expressed to Graham, such
thought&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such scruple&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;without
risk of exciting a tyrannous self-contempt: of kindling an inward
fire of shame so quenchless, and so devouring, that I think it
would soon have licked up the very life in my veins. Besides, my
godmother, knowing her son, and knowing me, would as soon have
thought of chaperoning a sister with a brother, as of keeping
anxious guard over our incomings and outgoings.</p>
<p id="id01838">The present was no occasion for showy array; my dun
mist crape would suffice, and I sought the same in the great
oak-wardrobe in the dormitory, where hung no less than forty
dresses. But there had been changes and reforms, and some
innovating hand had pruned this same crowded wardrobe, and carried
divers garments to the grenier&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my crape amongst
the rest. I must fetch it. I got the key, and went aloft fearless,
almost thoughtless. I unlocked the door, I plunged in. The reader
may believe it or not, but when I thus suddenly entered, that
garret was not wholly dark as it should have been: from one point
there shone a solemn light, like a star, but broader. So plainly it
shone, that it revealed the deep alcove with a portion of the
tarnished scarlet curtain drawn over it. Instantly, silently,
before my eyes, it vanished; so did the curtain and alcove: all
that end of the garret became black as night. I ventured no
research; I had not time nor will; snatching my dress, which hung
on the wall, happily near the door, I rushed out, relocked the door
with convulsed haste, and darted downwards to the dormitory.</p>
<p id="id01839">But I trembled too much to dress myself: impossible
to arrange hair or fasten hooks-and-eyes with such fingers, so I
called Rosine and bribed her to help me. Rosine liked a bribe, so
she did her best, smoothed and plaited my hair as well as a
coiffeur would have done, placed the lace collar mathematically
straight, tied the neck-ribbon accurately&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in
short, did her work like the neat-handed Phillis she could be when
she those. Having given me my handkerchief and gloves, she took the
candle and lighted me down-stairs. After all, I had forgotten my
shawl; she ran back to fetch it; and I stood with Dr. John in the
vestibule, waiting.</p>
<p id="id01840">"What is this, Lucy?" said he, looking down at me
narrowly. "Here is the old excitement. Ha! the nun again?"</p>
<p id="id01841">But I utterly denied the charge: I was vexed to be
suspected of a second illusion. He was sceptical.</p>
<p id="id01842">"She has been, as sure as I live," said he; "her
figure crossing your eyes leaves on them a peculiar gleam and
expression not to be mistaken."</p>
<p id="id01843">"She has <i>not</i> been," I persisted: for,
indeed, I could deny her apparition with truth.</p>
<p id="id01844">"The old symptoms are there," he affirmed: "a
particular pale, and what the Scotch call a 'raised' look."</p>
<p id="id01845">He was so obstinate, I thought it better to tell
him what I really <i>had</i> seen. Of course with him it was held
to be another effect of the same cause: it was all optical
illusion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nervous malady, and so on. Not one bit
did I believe him; but I dared not contradict: doctors are so
self-opinionated, so immovable in their dry, materialist views.</p>
<p id="id01846">Rosine brought the shawl, and I was bundled into
the carriage.</p>
<p id="id01847">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id01848">The theatre was full&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;crammed to
its roof: royal and noble were there: palace and hotel had emptied
their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed. Deeply
did I feel myself privileged in having a place before that stage; I
longed to see a being of whose powers I had heard reports which
made me conceive peculiar anticipations. I wondered if she would
justify her renown: with strange curiosity, with feelings severe
and austere, yet of riveted interest, I waited. She was a study of
such nature as had not encountered my eyes yet: a great and new
planet she was: but in what shape? I waited her rising.</p>
<p id="id01849">She rose at nine that December night: above the
horizon I saw her come. She could shine yet with pale grandeur and
steady might; but that star verged already on its judgment-day.
Seen near, it was a chaos&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hollow, half-consumed:
an orb perished or perishing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;half lava, half
glow.</p>
<p id="id01850">I had heard this woman termed "plain," and I
expected bony harshness and grimness&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something
large, angular, sallow. What I saw was the shadow of a royal
Vashti: a queen, fair as the day once, turned pale now like
twilight, and wasted like wax in flame.</p>
<p id="id01851">For awhile&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a long
while&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I thought it was only a woman, though an
unique woman, Who moved in might and grace before this multitude.
By-and-by I recognised my mistake. Behold! I found upon her
something neither of woman nor of man: in each of her eyes sat a
devil. These evil forces bore her through the tragedy, kept up her
feeble strength&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for she was but a frail
creature; and as the action rose and the stir deepened, how wildly
they shook her with their passions of the pit! They wrote HELL on
her straight, haughty brow. They tuned her voice to the note of
torment. They writhed her regal face to a demoniac mask. Hate and
Murder and Madness incarnate she stood.</p>
<p id="id01852">It was a marvellous sight: a mighty revelation.</p>
<p id="id01853">It was a spectacle low, horrible, immoral.</p>
<p id="id01854">Swordsmen thrust through, and dying in their blood
on the arena sand; bulls goring horses disembowelled, made a meeker
vision for the public&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a milder condiment for a
people's palate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;than Vashti torn by seven
devils: devils which cried sore and rent the tenement they haunted,
but still refused to be exorcised.</p>
<p id="id01855">Suffering had struck that stage empress; and she
stood before her audience neither yielding to, nor enduring, nor,
in finite measure, resenting it: she stood locked in struggle,
rigid in resistance. She stood, not dressed, but draped in pale
antique folds, long and regular like sculpture. A background and
entourage and flooring of deepest crimson threw her out, white like
alabaster&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;like silver: rather, be it said, like
Death.</p>
<p id="id01856">Where was the artist of the Cleopatra? Let him come
and sit down and study this different vision. Let him seek here the
mighty brawn, the muscle, the abounding blood, the full-fed flesh
he worshipped: let all materialists draw nigh and look on.</p>
<p id="id01857">I have said that she does not <i>resent</i> her
grief. No; the weakness of that word would make it a lie. To her,
what hurts becomes immediately embodied: she looks on it as a thing
that can be attacked, worried down, torn in shreds. Scarcely a
substance herself, she grapples to conflict with abstractions.
Before calamity she is a tigress; she rends her woes, shivers them
in convulsed abhorrence. Pain, for her, has no result in good:
tears water no harvest of wisdom: on sickness, on death itself, she
looks with the eye of a rebel. Wicked, perhaps, she is, but also
she is strong; and her strength has conquered Beauty, has overcome
Grace, and bound both at her side, captives peerlessly fair, and
docile as fair. Even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each
maenad movement royally, imperially, incedingly upborne. Her hair,
flying loose in revel or war, is still an angel's hair, and
glorious under a halo. Fallen, insurgent, banished, she remembers
the heaven where she rebelled. Heaven's light, following her exile,
pierces its confines, and discloses their forlorn remoteness.</p>
<p id="id01858">Place now the Cleopatra, or any other slug, before
her as an obstacle, and see her cut through the pulpy mass as the
scimitar of Saladin clove the down cushion. Let Paul Peter Rubens
wake from the dead, let him rise out of his cerements, and bring
into this presence all the army of his fat women; the magian power
or prophet-virtue gifting that slight rod of Moses, could, at one
waft, release and re-mingle a sea spell-parted, whelming the heavy
host with the down-rush of overthrown sea-ramparts.</p>
<p id="id01859">Vashti was not good, I was told; and I have said
she did not look good: though a spirit, she was a spirit out of
Tophet. Well, if so much of unholy force can arise from below, may
not an equal efflux of sacred essence descend one day from
above?</p>
<p id="id01860">What thought Dr. Graham of this being?</p>
<p id="id01861">For long intervals I forgot to look how he demeaned
himself, or to question what he thought. The strong magnetism of
genius drew my heart out of its wonted orbit; the sunflower turned
from the south to a fierce light, not solar&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
rushing, red, cometary light&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hot on vision and
to sensation. I had seen acting before, but never anything like
this: never anything which astonished Hope and hushed Desire; which
outstripped Impulse and paled Conception; which, instead of merely
irritating imagination with the thought of what <i>might</i> be
done, at the same time fevering the nerves because it was
<i>not</i> done, disclosed power like a deep, swollen winter river,
thundering in cataract, and bearing the soul, like a leaf, on the
steep and steelly sweep of its descent.</p>
<p id="id01862">Miss Fanshawe, with her usual ripeness of judgment,
pronounced Dr. Bretton a serious, impassioned man, too grave and
too impressible. Not in such light did I ever see him: no such
faults could I lay to his charge. His natural attitude was not the
meditative, nor his natural mood the sentimental;
<i>impressionable</i> he was as dimpling water, but, almost as
water, <i>unimpressible:</i> the breeze, the sun, moved
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;metal could not grave, nor fire brand.</p>
<p id="id01863">Dr. John <i>could</i> think and think well, but he
was rather a man of action than of thought; he <i>could</i> feel,
and feel vividly in his way, but his heart had no chord for
enthusiasm: to bright, soft, sweet influences his eyes and lips
gave bright, soft, sweet welcome, beautiful to see as dyes of rose
and silver, pearl and purple, imbuing summer clouds; for what
belonged to storm, what was wild and intense, dangerous, sudden,
and flaming, he had no sympathy, and held with it no communion.
When I took time and regained inclination to glance at him, it
amused and enlightened me to discover that he was watching that
sinister and sovereign Vashti, not with wonder, nor worship, nor
yet dismay, but simply with intense curiosity. Her agony did not
pain him, her wild moan&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;worse than a
shriek&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;did not much move him; her fury revolted
him somewhat, but not to the point of horror. Cool young Briton!
The pale cliffs of his own England do not look down on the tides of
the Channel more calmly than he watched the Pythian inspiration of
that night.</p>
<p id="id01864">Looking at his face, I longed to know his exact
opinions, and at last I put a question tending to elicit them. At
the sound of my voice he awoke as if out of a dream; for he had
been thinking, and very intently thinking, his own thoughts, after
his own manner. "How did he like Vashti?" I wished to know.</p>
<p id="id01865">"Hm-m-m," was the first scarce articulate but
expressive answer; and then such a strange smile went wandering
round his lips, a smile so critical, so almost callous! I suppose
that for natures of that order his sympathies <i>were</i> callous.
In a few terse phrases he told me his opinion of, and feeling
towards, the actress: he judged her as a woman, not an artist: it
was a branding judgment.</p>
<p id="id01866">That night was already marked in my book of life,
not with white, but with a deep-red cross. But I had not done with
it yet; and other memoranda were destined to be set down in
characters of tint indelible.</p>
<p id="id01867">Towards midnight, when the deepening tragedy
blackened to the death-scene, and all held their breath, and even
Graham bit his under-lip, and knit his brow, and sat still and
struck&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when the whole theatre was hushed, when
the vision of all eyes centred in one point, when all ears listened
towards one quarter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing being seen but the
white form sunk on a seat, quivering in conflict with her last, her
worst-hated, her visibly-conquering foe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing
heard but her throes, her gaspings, breathing yet of mutiny,
panting still defiance; when, as it seemed, an inordinate will,
convulsing a perishing mortal frame, bent it to battle with doom
and death, fought every inch of ground, sold every drop of blood,
resisted to the latest the rape of every faculty, <i>would</i> see,
<i>would</i> hear, <i>would</i> breathe, <i>would</i> live, up to,
within, well-nigh <i>beyond</i> the moment when death says to all
sense and all being&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Thus far and no
farther!"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id01868">Just then a stir, pregnant with omen, rustled
behind the scenes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;feet ran, voices spoke. What
was it? demanded the whole house. A flame, a smell of smoke
replied.</p>
<p id="id01869">"Fire!" rang through the gallery. "Fire!" was
repeated, re-echoed, yelled forth: and then, and faster than pen
can set it down, came panic, rushing, crushing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
blind, selfish, cruel chaos.</p>
<p id="id01870">And Dr. John? Reader, I see him yet, with his look
of comely courage and cordial calm.</p>
<p id="id01871">"Lucy will sit still, I know," said he, glancing
down at me with the same serene goodness, the same repose of
firmness that I have seen in him when sitting at his side amid the
secure peace of his mother's hearth. Yes, thus adjured, I think I
would have sat still under a rocking crag: but, indeed, to sit
still in actual circumstances was my instinct; and at the price of
my very life, I would not have moved to give him trouble, thwart
his will, or make demands on his attention. We were in the stalls,
and for a few minutes there was a most terrible, ruthless pressure
about us.</p>
<p id="id01872">"How terrified are the women!" said he; "but if the
men were not almost equally so, order might be maintained. This is
a sorry scene: I see fifty selfish brutes at this moment, each of
whom, if I were near, I could conscientiously knock down. I see
some women braver than some men. There is one
yonder&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Good God!"</p>
<p id="id01873">While Graham was speaking, a young girl who had
been very quietly and steadily clinging to a gentleman before us,
was suddenly struck from her protector's arms by a big, butcherly
intruder, and hurled under the feet of the crowd. Scarce two
seconds lasted her disappearance. Graham rushed forwards; he and
the gentleman, a powerful man though grey-haired, united their
strength to thrust back the throng; her head and long hair fell
back over his shoulder: she seemed unconscious.</p>
<p id="id01874">"Trust her with me; I am a medical man," said Dr.
John.</p>
<p id="id01875">"If you have no lady with you, be it so," was the
answer. "Hold her, and I will force a passage: we must get her to
the air."</p>
<p id="id01876">"I have a lady," said Graham; "but she will be
neither hindrance nor incumbrance."</p>
<p id="id01877">He summoned me with his eye: we were separated.
Resolute, however, to rejoin him, I penetrated the living barrier,
creeping under where I could not get between or over.</p>
<p id="id01878">"Fasten on me, and don't leave go," he said; and I
obeyed him.</p>
<p id="id01879">Our pioneer proved strong and adroit; he opened the
dense mass like a wedge; with patience and toil he at last bored
through the flesh-and-blood rock&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so solid, hot,
and suffocating&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and brought us to the fresh,
freezing night.</p>
<p id="id01880">"You are an Englishman!" said he, turning shortly
on Dr. Bretton, when we got into the street.</p>
<p id="id01881">"An Englishman. And I speak to a countryman?" was
the reply.</p>
<p id="id01882">"Right. Be good enough to stand here two minutes,
whilst I find my carriage."</p>
<p id="id01883">"Papa, I am not hurt," said a girlish voice; "am I
with papa?"</p>
<p id="id01884">"You are with a friend, and your father is close at
hand."</p>
<p id="id01885">"Tell him I am not hurt, except just in my
shoulder. Oh, my shoulder!<br />
They trod just here."<br /></p>
<p id="id01886">"Dislocation, perhaps!" muttered the Doctor: "let
us hope there is no worse injury done. Lucy, lend a hand one
instant."</p>
<p id="id01887">And I assisted while he made some arrangement of
drapery and position for the ease of his suffering burden. She
suppressed a moan, and lay in his arms quietly and patiently.</p>
<p id="id01888">"She is very light," said Graham, "like a child!"
and he asked in my ear, "Is she a child, Lucy? Did you notice her
age?"</p>
<p id="id01889">"I am not a child&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am a person
of seventeen," responded the patient, demurely and with dignity.
Then, directly after: "Tell papa to come; I get anxious."</p>
<p id="id01890">The carriage drove up; her father relieved Graham;
but in the exchange from one bearer to another she was hurt, and
moaned again.</p>
<p id="id01891">"My darling!" said the father, tenderly; then
turning to Graham, "You said, sir, you are a medical man?"</p>
<p id="id01892">"I am: Dr. Bretton, of La Terrasse."</p>
<p id="id01893">"Good. Will you step into my carriage?"</p>
<p id="id01894">"My own carriage is here: I will seek it, and
accompany you."</p>
<p id="id01895">"Be pleased, then, to follow us." And he named his
address: "The H&Atilde;&acute;tel<br />
Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy, in the Rue Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy."<br /></p>
<p id="id01896">We followed; the carriage drove fast; myself and
Graham were silent.<br />
This seemed like an adventure.<br /></p>
<p id="id01897">Some little time being lost in seeking our own
equipage, we reached the hotel perhaps about ten minutes after
these strangers. It was an hotel in the foreign sense: a collection
of dwelling-houses, not an inn&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a vast, lofty
pile, with a huge arch to its street-door, leading through a
vaulted covered way, into a square all built round.</p>
<p id="id01898">We alighted, passed up a wide, handsome public
staircase, and stopped at Num&Atilde;&copy;ro 2 on the second
landing; the first floor comprising the abode of I know not what
"prince Russe," as Graham informed me. On ringing the bell at a
second great door, we were admitted to a suite of very handsome
apartments. Announced by a servant in livery, we entered a
drawing-room whose hearth glowed with an English fire, and whose
walls gleamed with foreign mirrors. Near the hearth appeared a
little group: a slight form sunk in a deep arm-chair, one or two
women busy about it, the iron-grey gentleman anxiously looking
on.</p>
<p id="id01899">"Where is Harriet? I wish Harriet would come to
me," said the girlish voice, faintly.</p>
<p id="id01900">"Where is Mrs. Hurst?" demanded the gentleman
impatiently and somewhat sternly of the man-servant who had
admitted us.</p>
<p id="id01901">"I am sorry to say she is gone out of town, sir; my
young lady gave her leave till to-morrow."</p>
<p id="id01902">"Yes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I did&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
did. She is gone to see her sister; I said she might go:<br />
I remember now," interposed the young lady; "but I am so sorry,
for<br />
Manon and Louison cannot understand a word I say, and they hurt
me<br />
without meaning to do so."<br /></p>
<p id="id01903">Dr. John and the gentleman now interchanged
greetings; and while they passed a few minutes in consultation, I
approached the easy-chair, and seeing what the faint and sinking
girl wished to have done, I did it for her.</p>
<p id="id01904">I was still occupied in the arrangement, when
Graham drew near; he was no less skilled in surgery than medicine,
and, on examination, found that no further advice than his own was
necessary to the treatment of the present case. He ordered her to
be carried to her chamber, and whispered to
me:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Go with the women, Lucy; they seem but
dull; you can at least direct their movements, and thus spare her
some pain. She must be touched very tenderly."</p>
<p id="id01905">The chamber was a room shadowy with pale-blue
hangings, vaporous with curtainings and veilings of muslin; the bed
seemed to me like snow-drift and mist&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;spotless,
soft, and gauzy. Making the women stand apart, I undressed their
mistress, without their well-meaning but clumsy aid. I was not in a
sufficiently collected mood to note with separate distinctness
every detail of the attire I removed, but I received a general
impression of refinement, delicacy, and perfect personal
cultivation; which, in a period of after-thought, offered in my
reflections a singular contrast to notes retained of Miss Ginevra
Fanshawe's appointments.</p>
<p id="id01906">The girl was herself a small, delicate creature,
but made like a model. As I folded back her plentiful yet fine
hair, so shining and soft, and so exquisitely tended, I had under
my observation a young, pale, weary, but high-bred face. The brow
was smooth and clear; the eyebrows were distinct, but soft, and
melting to a mere trace at the temples; the eyes were a rich gift
of nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fine and full, large, deep, seeming to
hold dominion over the slighter subordinate
features&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;capable, probably, of much significance
at another hour and under other circumstances than the present, but
now languid and suffering. Her skin was perfectly fair, the neck
and hands veined finely like the petals of a flower; a thin glazing
of the ice of pride polished this delicate exterior, and her lip
wore a curl&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I doubt not inherent and
unconscious, but which, if I had seen it first with the
accompaniments of health and state, would have struck me as
unwarranted, and proving in the little lady a quite mistaken view
of life and her own consequence.</p>
<p id="id01907">Her demeanour under the Doctor's hands at first
excited a smile; it was not puerile&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rather, on
the whole, patient and firm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but yet, once or
twice she addressed him with suddenness and sharpness, saying that
he hurt her, and must contrive to give her less pain; I saw her
large eyes, too, settle on his face like the solemn eyes of some
pretty, wondering child. I know not whether Graham felt this
examination: if he did, he was cautious not to check or discomfort
it by any retaliatory look. I think he performed his work with
extreme care and gentleness, sparing her what pain he could; and
she acknowledged as much, when he had done, by the
words:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Thank you, Doctor, and good-night," very
gratefully pronounced as she uttered them, however, it was with a
repetition of the serious, direct gaze, I thought, peculiar in its
gravity and intentness.</p>
<p id="id01908">The injuries, it seems, were not dangerous: an
assurance which her father received with a smile that almost made
one his friend&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it was so glad and gratified. He
now expressed his obligations to Graham with as much earnestness as
was befitting an Englishman addressing one who has served him, but
is yet a stranger; he also begged him to call the next day.</p>
<p id="id01909">"Papa," said a voice from the veiled couch, "thank
the lady, too; is she there?"</p>
<p id="id01910">I opened the curtain with a smile, and looked in at
her. She lay now at comparative ease; she looked pretty, though
pale; her face was delicately designed, and if at first sight it
appeared proud, I believe custom might prove it to be soft.</p>
<p id="id01911">"I thank the lady very sincerely," said her father:
"I fancy she has been very good to my child. I think we scarcely
dare tell Mrs. Hurst who has been her substitute and done her work;
she will feel at once ashamed and jealous."</p>
<p id="id01912">And thus, in the most friendly spirit, parting
greetings were interchanged; and refreshment having been hospitably
offered, but by us, as it was late, refused, we withdrew from the
H&Atilde;&acute;tel Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy.</p>
<p id="id01913">On our way back we repassed the theatre. All was
silence and darkness: the roaring, rushing crowd all vanished and
gone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the damps, as well as the incipient fire,
extinct and forgotten. Next morning's papers explained that it was
but some loose drapery on which a spark had fallen, and which had
blazed up and been quenched in a moment.</p>
<h2 id="id01914" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h5 id="id01915">M. DE BASSOMPIERRE.</h5>
<p id="id01916" style="margin-top: 2em">Those who live in
retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of schools
or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be
suddenly and for a long while dropped out of the memory of their
friends, the denizens of a freer world. Unaccountably, perhaps, and
close upon some space of unusually frequent
intercourse&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some congeries of rather exciting
little circumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem to be
the quickening than the suspension of
communication&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there falls a stilly pause, a
wordless silence, a long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this
blank; alike entire and unexplained. The letter, the message once
frequent, are cut off; the visit, formerly periodical, ceases to
occur; the book, paper, or other token that indicated remembrance,
comes no more.</p>
<p id="id01917">Always there are excellent reasons for these
lapses, if the hermit but knew them. Though he is stagnant in his
cell, his connections without are whirling in the very vortex of
life. That void interval which passes for him so slowly that the
very clocks seem at a stand, and the wingless hours plod by in the
likeness of tired tramps prone to rest at
milestones&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that same interval, perhaps, teems
with events, and pants with hurry for his friends.</p>
<p id="id01918">The hermit&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if he be a sensible
hermit&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will swallow his own thoughts, and lock
up his own emotions during these weeks of inward winter. He will
know that Destiny designed him to imitate, on occasion, the
dormouse, and he will be conformable: make a tidy ball of himself,
creep into a hole of life's wall, and submit decently to the drift
which blows in and soon blocks him up, preserving him in ice for
the season.</p>
<p id="id01919">Let him say, "It is quite right: it ought to be so,
since so it is." And, perhaps, one day his snow-sepulchre will
open, spring's softness will return, the sun and south-wind will
reach him; the budding of hedges, and carolling of birds, and
singing of liberated streams, will call him to kindly resurrection.
<i>Perhaps</i> this may be the case, perhaps not: the frost may get
into his heart and never thaw more; when spring comes, a crow or a
pie may pick out of the wall only his dormouse-bones. Well, even in
that case, all will be right: it is to be supposed he knew from the
first he was mortal, and must one day go the way of all flesh, "As
well soon as syne."</p>
<p id="id01920">Following that eventful evening at the theatre,
came for me seven weeks as bare as seven sheets of blank paper: no
word was written on one of them; not a visit, not a token.</p>
<p id="id01921">About the middle of that time I entertained fancies
that something had happened to my friends at La Terrasse. The
mid-blank is always a beclouded point for the solitary: his nerves
ache with the strain of long expectancy; the doubts hitherto
repelled gather now to a mass and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strong in
accumulation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;roll back upon him with a force
which savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an unkindly
time, and sleep and his nature cannot agree: strange starts and
struggles harass his couch: the sinister band of bad dreams, with
horror of calamity, and sick dread of entire desertion at their
head, join the league against him. Poor wretch! He does his best to
bear up, but he is a poor, pallid, wasting wretch, despite that
best.</p>
<p id="id01922">Towards the last of these long seven weeks I
admitted, what through the other six I had jealously
excluded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the conviction that these blanks were
inevitable: the result of circumstances, the fiat of fate, a part
of my life's lot and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;above
all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a matter about whose origin no question must
ever be asked, for whose painful sequence no murmur ever uttered.
Of course I did not blame myself for suffering: I thank God I had a
truer sense of justice than to fall into any imbecile extravagance
of self-accusation; and as to blaming others for silence, in my
reason I well knew them blameless, and in my heart acknowledged
them so: but it was a rough and heavy road to travel, and I longed
for better days.</p>
<p id="id01923">I tried different expedients to sustain and fill
existence: I commenced an elaborate piece of lace-work, I studied
German pretty hard, I undertook a course of regular reading of the
driest and thickest books in the library; in all my efforts I was
as orthodox as I knew how to be. Was there error somewhere? Very
likely. I only know the result was as if I had gnawed a file to
satisfy hunger, or drank brine to quench thirst.</p>
<p id="id01924">My hour of torment was the post-hour.
Unfortunately, I knew it too well, and tried as vainly as
assiduously to cheat myself of that knowledge; dreading the rack of
expectation, and the sick collapse of disappointment which daily
preceded and followed upon that well-recognised ring.</p>
<p id="id01925">I suppose animals kept in cages, and so scantily
fed as to be always upon the verge of famine, await their food as I
awaited a letter. Oh!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to speak truth, and drop
that tone of a false calm which long to sustain, outwears nature's
endurance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I underwent in those seven weeks
bitter fears and pains, strange inward trials, miserable defections
of hope, intolerable encroachments of despair. This last came so
near me sometimes that her breath went right through me. I used to
feel it like a baleful air or sigh, penetrate deep, and make motion
pause at my heart, or proceed only under unspeakable oppression.
The letter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the well-beloved
letter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;would not come; and it was all of
sweetness in life I had to look for.</p>
<p id="id01926">In the very extremity of want, I had recourse
again, and yet again, to the little packet in the
case&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the five letters. How splendid that month
seemed whose skies had beheld the rising of these five stars! It
was always at night I visited them, and not daring to ask every
evening for a candle in the kitchen, I bought a wax taper and
matches to light it, and at the study-hour stole up to the
dormitory and feasted on my crust from the Barmecide's loaf. It did
not nourish me: I pined on it, and got as thin as a shadow:
otherwise I was not ill.</p>
<p id="id01927">Reading there somewhat late one evening, and
feeling that the power to read was leaving
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for the letters from incessant perusal were
losing all sap and significance: my gold was withering to leaves
before my eyes, and I was sorrowing over the
disillusion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;suddenly a quick tripping foot ran
up the stairs. I knew Ginevra Fanshawe's step: she had dined in
town that afternoon; she was now returned, and would come here to
replace her shawl, &amp;c. in the wardrobe.</p>
<p id="id01928">Yes: in she came, dressed in bright silk, with her
shawl falling from her shoulders, and her curls, half-uncurled in
the damp of night, drooping careless and heavy upon her neck. I had
hardly time to recasket my treasures and lock them up when she was
at my side her humour seemed none of the best.</p>
<p id="id01929">"It has been a stupid evening: they are stupid
people," she began.</p>
<p id="id01930">"Who? Mrs. Cholmondeley? I thought you always found
her house charming?"</p>
<p id="id01931">"I have not been to Mrs. Cholmondeley's."</p>
<p id="id01932">"Indeed! Have you made new acquaintance?"</p>
<p id="id01933">"My uncle de Bassompierre is come."</p>
<p id="id01934">"Your uncle de Bassompierre! Are you not
glad?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I thought he was a favourite."</p>
<p id="id01935">"You thought wrong: the man is odious; I hate
him."</p>
<p id="id01936">"Because he is a foreigner? or for what other
reason of equal weight?"</p>
<p id="id01937">"He is not a foreigner. The man is English enough,
goodness knows; and had an English name till three or four years
ago; but his mother was a foreigner, a de Bassompierre, and some of
her family are dead and have left him estates, a title, and this
name: he is quite a great man now."</p>
<p id="id01938">"Do you hate him for that reason?"</p>
<p id="id01939">"Don't I know what mamma says about him? He is not
my own uncle, but married mamma's sister. Mamma detests him; she
says he killed aunt Ginevra with unkindness: he looks like a bear.
Such a dismal evening!" she went on. "I'll go no more to his big
hotel. Fancy me walking into a room alone, and a great man fifty
years old coming forwards, and after a few minutes' conversation
actually turning his back upon me, and then abruptly going out of
the room. Such odd ways! I daresay his conscience smote him, for
they all say at home I am the picture of aunt Ginevra. Mamma often
declares the likeness is quite ridiculous."</p>
<p id="id01940">"Were you the only visitor?"</p>
<p id="id01941">"The only visitor? Yes; then there was missy, my
cousin: little spoiled, pampered thing."</p>
<p id="id01942">"M. de Bassompierre has a daughter?"</p>
<p id="id01943">"Yes, yes: don't tease one with questions. Oh,
dear! I am so tired."</p>
<p id="id01944">She yawned. Throwing herself without ceremony on my
bed she added, "It seems Mademoiselle was nearly crushed to a jelly
in a hubbub at the theatre some weeks ago."</p>
<p id="id01945">"Ah! indeed. And they live at a large hotel in the
Rue Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy?"</p>
<p id="id01946">"Justement. How do <i>you</i> know?"</p>
<p id="id01947">"I have been there."</p>
<p id="id01948">"Oh, you have? Really! You go everywhere in these
days. I suppose Mother Bretton took you. She and Esculapius have
the <i>entr&Atilde;&copy;e</i> of the de Bassompierre apartments:
it seems 'my son John' attended missy on the occasion of her
accident&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Accident? Bah! All affectation! I don't
think she was squeezed more than she richly deserves for her airs.
And now there is quite an intimacy struck up: I heard something
about 'auld lang syne,' and what not. Oh, how stupid they all
were!"</p>
<p id="id01949">"<i>All!</i> You said you were the only
visitor."</p>
<p id="id01950">"Did I? You see one forgets to particularize an old
woman and her boy."</p>
<p id="id01951">"Dr. and Mrs. Bretton were at M. de Bassompierre's
this evening?"</p>
<p id="id01952">"Ay, ay! as large as life; and missy played the
hostess. What a conceited doll it is!"</p>
<p id="id01953">Soured and listless, Miss Fanshawe was beginning to
disclose the causes of her prostrate condition. There had been a
retrenchment of incense, a diversion or a total withholding of
homage and attention coquetry had failed of effect, vanity had
undergone mortification. She lay fuming in the vapours.</p>
<p id="id01954">"Is Miss de Bassompierre quite well now?" I
asked.</p>
<p id="id01955">"As well as you or I, no doubt; but she is an
affected little thing, and gave herself invalid airs to attract
medical notice. And to see the old dowager making her recline on a
couch, and 'my son John' prohibiting excitement,
etcetera&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;faugh! the scene was quite
sickening."</p>
<p id="id01956">"It would not have been so if the object of
attention had been changed: if you had taken Miss de Bassompierre's
place."</p>
<p id="id01957">"Indeed! I hate 'my son John!'"</p>
<p id="id01958">"'My son John!'&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whom do you
indicate by that name? Dr. Bretton's mother never calls him
so."</p>
<p id="id01959">"Then she ought. A clownish, bearish John he
is."</p>
<p id="id01960">"You violate the truth in saying so; and as the
whole of my patience is now spun off the distaff, I peremptorily
desire you to rise from that bed, and vacate this room."</p>
<p id="id01961">"Passionate thing! Your face is the colour of a
coquelicot. I wonder what always makes you so mighty testy
&Atilde;&nbsp; l'endroit du gros Jean? 'John Anderson, my Joe,
John!' Oh, the distinguished name!"</p>
<p id="id01962">Thrilling with exasperation, to which it would have
been sheer folly to have given vent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for there
was no contending with that unsubstantial feather, that
mealy-winged moth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I extinguished my taper,
locked my bureau, and left her, since she would not leave me.
Small-beer as she was, she had turned insufferably acid.</p>
<p id="id01963">The morrow was Thursday and a half-holiday.
Breakfast was over; I had withdrawn to the first classe. The
dreaded hour, the post-hour, was nearing, and I sat waiting it,
much as a ghost-seer might wait his spectre. Less than ever was a
letter probable; still, strive as I would, I could not forget that
it was possible. As the moments lessened, a restlessness and fear
almost beyond the average assailed me. It was a day of winter east
wind, and I had now for some time entered into that dreary
fellowship with the winds and their changes, so little known, so
incomprehensible to the healthy. The north and east owned a
terrific influence, making all pain more poignant, all sorrow
sadder. The south could calm, the west sometimes cheer: unless,
indeed, they brought on their wings the burden of thunder-clouds,
under the weight and warmth of which all energy died.</p>
<p id="id01964">Bitter and dark as was this January day, I remember
leaving the classe, and running down without bonnet to the bottom
of the long garden, and then lingering amongst the stripped shrubs,
in the forlorn hope that the postman's ring might occur while I was
out of hearing, and I might thus be spared the thrill which some
particular nerve or nerves, almost gnawed through with the
unremitting tooth of a fixed idea, were becoming wholly unfit to
support. I lingered as long as I dared without fear of attracting
attention by my absence. I muffled my head in my apron, and stopped
my ears in terror of the torturing clang, sure to be followed by
such blank silence, such barren vacuum for me. At last I ventured
to re-enter the first classe, where, as it was not yet nine
o'clock, no pupils had been admitted. The first thing seen was a
white object on my black desk, a white, flat object. The post had,
indeed, arrived; by me unheard. Rosine had visited my cell, and,
like some angel, had left behind her a bright token of her
presence. That shining thing on the desk was indeed a letter, a
real letter; I saw so much at the distance of three yards, and as I
had but one correspondent on earth, from that one it must come. He
remembered me yet. How deep a pulse of gratitude sent new life
through my heart.</p>
<p id="id01965">Drawing near, bending and looking on the letter, in
trembling but almost certain hope of seeing a known hand, it was my
lot to find, on the contrary, an autograph for the moment deemed
unknown&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a pale female scrawl, instead of a firm,
masculine character. I then thought fate was <i>too</i> hard for
me, and I said, audibly, "This is cruel."</p>
<p id="id01966">But I got over that pain also. Life is still life,
whatever its pangs: our eyes and ears and their use remain with us,
though the prospect of what pleases be wholly withdrawn, and the
sound of what consoles be quite silenced.</p>
<p id="id01967">I opened the billet: by this time I had recognised
its handwriting as perfectly familiar. It was dated "La Terrasse,"
and it ran thus:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id01968">"DEAR LUCY,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;It occurs to me to
inquire what you have been doing with yourself for the last month
or two? Not that I suspect you would have the least difficulty in
giving an account of your proceedings. I daresay you have been just
as busy and as happy as ourselves at La Terrasse. As to Graham, his
professional connection extends daily: he is so much sought after,
so much engaged, that I tell him he will grow quite conceited. Like
a right good mother, as I am, I do my best to keep him down: no
flattery does he get from me, as you know. And yet, Lucy, he is a
fine fellow: his mother's heart dances at the sight of him. After
being hurried here and there the whole day, and passing the ordeal
of fifty sorts of tempers, and combating a hundred caprices, and
sometimes witnessing cruel sufferings&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps,
occasionally, as I tell him, inflicting them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at
night he still comes home to me in such kindly, pleasant mood, that
really, I seem to live in a sort of moral antipodes, and on these
January evenings my day rises when other people's night sets
in.</p>
<p id="id01969">"Still he needs keeping in order, and correcting,
and repressing, and I do him that good service; but the boy is so
elastic there is no such thing as vexing him thoroughly. When I
think I have at last driven him to the sullens, he turns on me with
jokes for retaliation: but you know him and all his iniquities, and
I am but an elderly simpleton to make him the subject of this
epistle.</p>
<p id="id01970">"As for me, I have had my old Bretton agent here on
a visit, and have been plunged overhead and ears in business
matters. I do so wish to regain for Graham at least some part of
what his father left him. He laughs to scorn my anxiety on this
point, bidding me look and see how he can provide for himself and
me too, and asking what the old lady can possibly want that she has
not; hinting about sky-blue turbans; accusing me of an ambition to
wear diamonds, keep livery servants, have an hotel, and lead the
fashion amongst the English clan in Villette.</p>
<p id="id01971">"Talking of sky-blue turbans, I wish you had been
with us the other evening. He had come in really tired, and after I
had given him his tea, he threw himself into my chair with his
customary presumption. To my great delight, he dropped asleep. (You
know how he teases me about being drowsy; I, who never, by any
chance, close an eye by daylight.) While he slept, I thought he
looked very bonny, Lucy: fool as I am to be so proud of him; but
who can help it? Show me his peer. Look where I will, I see nothing
like him in Villette. Well, I took it into my head to play him a
trick: so I brought out the sky-blue turban, and handling it with
gingerly precaution, I managed to invest his brows with this grand
adornment. I assure you it did not at all misbecome him; he looked
quite Eastern, except that he is so fair. Nobody, however, can
accuse him of having red hair <i>now</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is
genuine chestnut&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a dark, glossy chestnut; and
when I put my large cashmere about him, there was as fine a young
bey, dey, or pacha improvised as you would wish to see.</p>
<p id="id01972">"It was good entertainment; but only half-enjoyed,
since I was alone: you should have been there.</p>
<p id="id01973">"In due time my lord awoke: the looking-glass above
the fireplace soon intimated to him his plight: as you may imagine,
I now live under threat and dread of vengeance.</p>
<p id="id01974">"But to come to the gist of my letter. I know
Thursday is a half-holiday in the Rue Fossette: be ready, then, by
five in the afternoon, at which hour I will send the carriage to
take you out to La Terrasse. Be sure to come: you may meet some old
acquaintance. Good-by, my wise, dear, grave little
god-daughter.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Very truly yours,</p>
<h5 id="id01975">"LOUISA BRETTON.".</h5>
<p id="id01976">Now, a letter like that sets one to rights! I might
still be sad after reading that letter, but I was more composed;
not exactly cheered, perhaps, but relieved. My friends, at least,
were well and happy: no accident had occurred to Graham; no illness
had seized his mother-calamities that had so long been my dream and
thought. Their feelings for me too were&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as they
had been. Yet, how strange it was to look on Mrs. Bretton's seven
weeks and contrast them with my seven weeks! Also, how very wise it
is in people placed in an exceptional position to hold their
tongues and not rashly declare how such position galls them! The
world can understand well enough the process of perishing for want
of food: perhaps few persons can enter into or follow out that of
going mad from solitary confinement. They see the long-buried
prisoner disinterred, a maniac or an idiot!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how
his senses left him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how his nerves, first
inflamed, underwent nameless agony, and then sunk to
palsy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is a subject too intricate for
examination, too abstract for popular comprehension. Speak of it!
you might almost as well stand up in an European market-place, and
propound dark sayings in that language and mood wherein
Nebuchadnezzar, the imperial hypochondriac, communed with his
baffled Chaldeans. And long, long may the minds to whom such themes
are no mystery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;by whom their bearings are
sympathetically seized&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;be few in number, and
rare of rencounter. Long may it be generally thought that physical
privations alone merit compassion, and that the rest is a figment.
When the world was younger and haler than now, moral trials were a
deeper mystery still: perhaps in all the land of Israel there was
but one Saul&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;certainly but one David to soothe
or comprehend him.</p>
<p id="id01977">The keen, still cold of the morning was succeeded,
later in the day, by a sharp breathing from Russian wastes: the
cold zone sighed over the temperate zone, and froze it fast. A
heavy firmament, dull, and thick with snow, sailed up from the
north, and settled over expectant Europe. Towards afternoon began
the descent. I feared no carriage would come, the white tempest
raged so dense and wild. But trust my godmother! Once having asked,
she would have her guest. About six o'clock I was lifted from the
carriage over the already blocked-up front steps of the
ch&Atilde;&cent;teau, and put in at the door of La Terrasse.</p>
<p id="id01978">Running through the vestibule, and up-stairs to the
drawing-room, there I found Mrs. Bretton&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
summer-day in her own person. Had I been twice as cold as I was,
her kind kiss and cordial clasp would have warmed me. Inured now
for so long a time to rooms with bare boards, black benches, desks,
and stoves, the blue saloon seemed to me gorgeous. In its
Christmas-like fire alone there was a clear and crimson splendour
which quite dazzled me.</p>
<p id="id01979">When my godmother had held my hand for a little
while, and chatted with me, and scolded me for having become
thinner than when she last saw me, she professed to discover that
the snow-wind had disordered my hair, and sent me up-stairs to make
it neat and remove my shawl.</p>
<p id="id01980">Repairing to my own little sea-green room, there
also I found a bright fire, and candles too were lit: a tall
waxlight stood on each side the great looking glass; but between
the candles, and before the glass, appeared something dressing
itself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an airy, fairy
thing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;small, slight, white&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
winter spirit.</p>
<p id="id01981">I declare, for one moment I thought of Graham and
his spectral illusions. With distrustful eye I noted the details of
this new vision. It wore white, sprinkled slightly with drops of
scarlet; its girdle was red; it had something in its hair leafy,
yet shining&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a little wreath with an evergreen
gloss. Spectral or not, here truly was nothing frightful, and I
advanced.</p>
<p id="id01982">Turning quick upon me, a large eye, under long
lashes, flashed over me, the intruder: the lashes were as dark as
long, and they softened with their pencilling the orb they
guarded.</p>
<p id="id01983">"Ah! you are come!" she breathed out, in a soft,
quiet voice, and she smiled slowly, and gazed intently.</p>
<p id="id01984">I knew her now. Having only once seen that sort of
face, with that cast of fine and delicate featuring, I could not
but know her.</p>
<p id="id01985">"Miss de Bassompierre," I pronounced.</p>
<p id="id01986">"No," was the reply, "not Miss de Bassompierre for
<i>you!</i>" I did not inquire who then she might be, but waited
voluntary information.</p>
<p id="id01987">"You are changed, but still you are yourself," she
said, approaching nearer. "I remember you
well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;your countenance, the colour of your hair,
the outline of your face&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."</p>
<p id="id01988">I had moved to the fire, and she stood opposite,
and gazed into me; and as she gazed, her face became gradually more
and more expressive of thought and feeling, till at last a dimness
quenched her clear vision.</p>
<p id="id01989">"It makes me almost cry to look so far back," said
she: "but as to being sorry, or sentimental, don't think it: on the
contrary, I am quite pleased and glad."</p>
<p id="id01990">Interested, yet altogether at fault, I knew not
what to say. At last I stammered, "I think I never met you till
that night, some weeks ago, when you were
hurt&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;?"</p>
<p id="id01991">She smiled. "You have forgotten then that I have
sat on your knee, been lifted in your arms, even shared your
pillow? You no longer remember the night when I came crying, like a
naughty little child as I was, to your bedside, and you took me in.
You have no memory for the comfort and protection by which you
soothed an acute distress? Go back to Bretton. Remember Mr.
Home."</p>
<p id="id01992">At last I saw it all. "And you are little
Polly?"</p>
<p id="id01993">"I am Paulina Mary Home de Bassompierre."</p>
<p id="id01994">How time can change! Little Polly wore in her pale,
small features, her fairy symmetry, her varying expression, a
certain promise of interest and grace; but Paulina Mary was become
beautiful&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not with the beauty that strikes the
eye like a rose&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;orbed, ruddy, and replete; not
with the plump, and pink, and flaxen attributes of her blond cousin
Ginevra; but her seventeen years had brought her a refined and
tender charm which did not lie in complexion, though hers was fair
and clear; nor in outline, though her features were sweet, and her
limbs perfectly turned; but, I think, rather in a subdued glow from
the soul outward. This was not an opaque vase, of material however
costly, but a lamp chastely lucent, guarding from extinction, yet
not hiding from worship, a flame vital and vestal. In speaking of
her attractions, I would not exaggerate language; but, indeed, they
seemed to me very real and engaging. What though all was on a small
scale, it was the perfume which gave this white violet distinction,
and made it superior to the broadest camelia&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
fullest dahlia that ever bloomed.</p>
<p id="id01995">"Ah! and you remember the old time at Bretton?"</p>
<p id="id01996">"Better," said she, "better, perhaps, than you. I
remember it with minute distinctness: not only the time, but the
days of the time, and the hours of the days."</p>
<p id="id01997">"You must have forgotten some things?"</p>
<p id="id01998">"Very little, I imagine."</p>
<p id="id01999">"You were then a little creature of quick feelings:
you must, long ere this, have outgrown the impressions with which
joy and grief, affection and bereavement, stamped your mind ten
years ago."</p>
<p id="id02000">"You think I have forgotten whom I liked, and in
what degree I liked them when a child?"</p>
<p id="id02001">"The sharpness must be gone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
point, the poignancy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the deep imprint must be
softened away and effaced?"</p>
<p id="id02002">"I have a good memory for those days."</p>
<p id="id02003">She looked as if she had. Her eyes were the eyes of
one who can remember; one whose childhood does not fade like a
dream, nor whose youth vanish like a sunbeam. She would not take
life, loosely and incoherently, in parts, and let one season slip
as she entered on another: she would retain and add; often review
from the commencement, and so grow in harmony and consistency as
she grew in years. Still I could not quite admit the conviction
that <i>all</i> the pictures which now crowded upon me were vivid
and visible to her. Her fond attachments, her sports and contests
with a well-loved playmate, the patient, true devotion of her
child's heart, her fears, her delicate reserves, her little trials,
the last piercing pain of separation&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. I
retraced these things, and shook my head incredulous. She
persisted. "The child of seven years lives yet in the girl of
seventeen," said she.</p>
<p id="id02004">"You used to be excessively fond of Mrs. Bretton,"
I remarked, intending to test her. She set me right at once.</p>
<p id="id02005">"Not <i>excessively</i> fond," said she; "I liked
her: I respected her as I should do now: she seems to me very
little altered."</p>
<p id="id02006">"She is not much changed," I assented.</p>
<p id="id02007">We were silent a few minutes. Glancing round the
room she said, "There are several things here that used to be at
Bretton! I remember that pincushion and that looking-glass."</p>
<p id="id02008">Evidently she was not deceived in her estimate of
her own memory; not, at least, so far.</p>
<p id="id02009">"You think, then, you would have known Mrs.
Bretton?" I went on.</p>
<p id="id02010">"I perfectly remembered her; the turn of her
features, her olive complexion, and black hair, her height, her
walk, her voice."</p>
<p id="id02011">"Dr. Bretton, of course," I pursued, "would be out
of the question: and, indeed, as I saw your first interview with
him, I am aware that he appeared to you as a stranger."</p>
<p id="id02012">"That first night I was puzzled," she answered.</p>
<p id="id02013">"How did the recognition between him and your
father come about?"</p>
<p id="id02014">"They exchanged cards. The names Graham Bretton and
Home de Bassompierre gave rise to questions and explanations. That
was on the second day; but before then I was beginning to know
something."</p>
<p id="id02015">"How&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;know something?"</p>
<p id="id02016">"Why," she said, "how strange it is that most
people seem so slow to feel the truth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not to
see, but <i>feel</i>! When Dr. Bretton had visited me a few times,
and sat near and talked to me; when I had observed the look in his
eyes, the expression about his mouth, the form of his chin, the
carriage of his head, and all that we <i>do</i> observe in persons
who approach us&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how could I avoid being led by
association to think of Graham Bretton? Graham was slighter than
he, and not grown so tall, and had a smoother face, and longer and
lighter hair, and spoke&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not so
deeply&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;more like a girl; but yet <i>he</i> is
Graham, just as <i>I</i> am little Polly, or you are Lucy
Snowe."</p>
<p id="id02017">I thought the same, but I wondered to find my
thoughts hers: there are certain things in which we so rarely meet
with our double that it seems a miracle when that chance
befalls.</p>
<p id="id02018">"You and Graham were once playmates."</p>
<p id="id02019">"And do you remember that?" she questioned in her
turn.</p>
<p id="id02020">"No doubt he will remember it also," said I.</p>
<p id="id02021">"I have not asked him: few things would surprise me
so much as to find that he did. I suppose his disposition is still
gay and careless?"</p>
<p id="id02022">"Was it so formerly? Did it so strike you? Do you
thus remember him?"</p>
<p id="id02023">"I scarcely remember him in any other light.
Sometimes he was studious; sometimes he was merry: but whether busy
with his books or disposed for play, it was chiefly the books or
game he thought of; not much heeding those with whom he read or
amused himself."</p>
<p id="id02024">"Yet to you he was partial."</p>
<p id="id02025">"Partial to me? Oh, no! he had other
playmates&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his school-fellows; I was of little
consequence to him, except on Sundays: yes, he was kind on Sundays.
I remember walking with him hand-in-hand to St. Mary's, and his
finding the places in my prayer-book; and how good and still he was
on Sunday evenings! So mild for such a proud, lively boy; so
patient with all my blunders in reading; and so wonderfully to be
depended on, for he never spent those evenings from home: I had a
constant fear that he would accept some invitation and forsake us;
but he never did, nor seemed ever to wish to do it. Thus, of
course, it can be no more. I suppose Sunday will now be Dr.
Bretton's dining-out day&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.?"</p>
<p id="id02026">"Children, come down!" here called Mrs. Bretton
from below. Paulina would still have lingered, but I inclined to
descend: we went down.</p>
<h2 id="id02027" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h5 id="id02028">THE LITTLE COUNTESS.</h5>
<p id="id02029" style="margin-top: 2em">Cheerful as my godmother
naturally was, and entertaining as, for our sakes, she made a point
of being, there was no true enjoyment that evening at La Terrasse,
till, through the wild howl of the winter-night, were heard the
signal sounds of arrival. How often, while women and girls sit warm
at snug fire-sides, their hearts and imaginations are doomed to
divorce from the comfort surrounding their persons, forced out by
night to wander through dark ways, to dare stress of weather, to
contend with the snow-blast, to wait at lonely gates and stiles in
wildest storms, watching and listening to see and hear the father,
the son, the husband coming home.</p>
<p id="id02030">Father and son came at last to the
ch&Atilde;&cent;teau: for the Count de Bassompierre that night
accompanied Dr. Bretton. I know not which of our trio heard the
horses first; the asperity, the violence of the weather warranted
our running down into the hall to meet and greet the two riders as
they came in; but they warned us to keep our distance: both were
white&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;two mountains of snow; and indeed Mrs.
Bretton, seeing their condition, ordered them instantly to the
kitchen; prohibiting them, at their peril, from setting foot on her
carpeted staircase till they had severally put off that mask of Old
Christmas they now affected. Into the kitchen, however, we could
not help following them: it was a large old Dutch kitchen,
picturesque and pleasant. The little white Countess danced in a
circle about her equally white sire, clapping her hands and crying,
"Papa, papa, you look like an enormous Polar bear."</p>
<p id="id02031">The bear shook himself, and the little sprite fled
far from the frozen shower. Back she came, however, laughing, and
eager to aid in removing the arctic disguise. The Count, at last
issuing from his dreadnought, threatened to overwhelm her with it
as with an avalanche.</p>
<p id="id02032">"Come, then," said she, bending to invite the fall,
and when it was playfully advanced above her head, bounding out of
reach like some little chamois.</p>
<p id="id02033">Her movements had the supple softness, the velvet
grace of a kitten; her laugh was clearer than the ring of silver
and crystal; as she took her sire's cold hands and rubbed them, and
stood on tiptoe to reach his lips for a kiss, there seemed to shine
round her a halo of loving delight. The grave and reverend seignor
looked down on her as men <i>do</i> look on what is the apple of
their eye.</p>
<p id="id02034">"Mrs. Bretton," said he: "what am I to do with this
daughter or daughterling of mine? She neither grows in wisdom nor
in stature. Don't you find her pretty nearly as much the child as
she was ten years ago?"</p>
<p id="id02035">"She cannot be more the child than this great boy
of mine," said Mrs. Bretton, who was in conflict with her son about
some change of dress she deemed advisable, and which he resisted.
He stood leaning against the Dutch dresser, laughing and keeping
her at arm's length.</p>
<p id="id02036">"Come, mamma," said he, "by way of compromise, and
to secure for us inward as well as outward warmth, let us have a
Christmas wassail-cup, and toast Old England here, on the
hearth."</p>
<p id="id02037">So, while the Count stood by the fire, and Paulina
Mary still danced to and fro&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;happy in the
liberty of the wide hall-like kitchen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Mrs.
Bretton herself instructed Martha to spice and heat the
wassail-bowl, and, pouring the draught into a Bretton flagon, it
was served round, reaming hot, by means of a small silver vessel,
which I recognised as Graham's christening-cup.</p>
<p id="id02038">"Here's to Auld Lang Syne!" said the Count; holding
the glancing cup on high. Then, looking at Mrs.
Bretton.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02039">&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;"We twa ha' paidlet i'
the burn<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Fra
morning sun till dine,<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;But seas between us braid ha'
roared<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Sin'
auld lane syne.<br /></p>
<p id="id02040">&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;"And surely ye'll be your
pint-stoup,<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;And
surely I'll be mine;<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;And we'll taste a cup o' kindness
yet<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;For
auld lang syne."<br /></p>
<p id="id02041">"Scotch! Scotch!" cried Paulina; "papa is talking
Scotch; and Scotch he is, partly. We are Home and de Bassompierre,
Caledonian and Gallic."</p>
<p id="id02042">"And is that a Scotch reel you are dancing, you
Highland fairy?" asked her father. "Mrs. Bretton, there will be a
green ring growing up in the middle of your kitchen shortly. I
would not answer for her being quite cannie: she is a strange
little mortal."</p>
<p id="id02043">"Tell Lucy to dance with me, papa; there is Lucy
Snowe."</p>
<p id="id02044">Mr. Home (there was still quite as much about him
of plain Mr. Home as of proud Count de Bassompierre) held his hand
out to me, saying kindly, "he remembered me well; and, even had his
own memory been less trustworthy, my name was so often on his
daughter's lips, and he had listened to so many long tales about
me, I should seem like an old acquaintance."</p>
<p id="id02045">Every one now had tasted the wassail-cup except
Paulina, whose pas de f&Atilde;&copy;e, ou de fantaisie, nobody
thought of interrupting to offer so profanatory a draught; but she
was not to be overlooked, nor baulked of her mortal privileges.</p>
<p id="id02046">"Let me taste," said she to Graham, as he was
putting the cup on the shelf of the dresser out of her reach.</p>
<p id="id02047">Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home were now engaged in
conversation. Dr. John had not been unobservant of the fairy's
dance; he had watched it, and he had liked it. To say nothing of
the softness and beauty of the movements, eminently grateful to his
grace-loving eye, that ease in his mother's house charmed him, for
it set <i>him</i> at ease: again she seemed a child for
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;again, almost his playmate. I wondered how
he would speak to her; I had not yet seen him address her; his
first words proved that the old days of "little Polly" had been
recalled to his mind by this evening's child-like
light-heartedness.</p>
<p id="id02048">"Your ladyship wishes for the tankard?"</p>
<p id="id02049">"I think I said so. I think I intimated as
much."</p>
<p id="id02050">"Couldn't consent to a step of the kind on any
account. Sorry for it, but couldn't do it."</p>
<p id="id02051">"Why? I am quite well now: it can't break my
collar-bone again, or dislocate my shoulder. Is it wine?"</p>
<p id="id02052">"No; nor dew."</p>
<p id="id02053">"I don't want dew; I don't like dew: but what is
it?"</p>
<p id="id02054">"Ale&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strong
ale&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;old October; brewed, perhaps, when I was
born."</p>
<p id="id02055">"It must be curious: is it good?"</p>
<p id="id02056">"Excessively good."</p>
<p id="id02057">And he took it down, administered to himself a
second dose of this mighty elixir, expressed in his mischievous
eyes extreme contentment with the same, and solemnly replaced the
cup on the shelf.</p>
<p id="id02058">"I should like a little," said Paulina, looking up;
"I never had any 'old October:' is it sweet?"</p>
<p id="id02059">"Perilously sweet," said Graham.</p>
<p id="id02060">She continued to look up exactly with the
countenance of a child that longs for some prohibited dainty. At
last the Doctor relented, took it down, and indulged himself in the
gratification of letting her taste from his hand; his eyes, always
expressive in the revelation of pleasurable feelings, luminously
and smilingly avowed that it <i>was</i> a gratification; and he
prolonged it by so regulating the position of the cup that only a
drop at a time could reach the rosy, sipping lips by which its brim
was courted.</p>
<p id="id02061">"A little more&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a little more,"
said she, petulantly touching his hand with the forefinger, to make
him incline the cup more generously and yieldingly. "It smells of
spice and sugar, but I can't taste it; your wrist is so stiff, and
you are so stingy."</p>
<p id="id02062">He indulged her, whispering, however, with gravity:
"Don't tell my mother or Lucy; they wouldn't approve."</p>
<p id="id02063">"Nor do I," said she, passing into another tone and
manner as soon as she had fairly assayed the beverage, just as if
it had acted upon her like some disenchanting draught, undoing the
work of a wizard: "I find it anything but sweet; it is bitter and
hot, and takes away my breath. Your old October was only desirable
while forbidden. Thank you, no more."</p>
<p id="id02064">And, with a slight
bend&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;careless, but as graceful as her
dance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she glided from him and rejoined her
father.</p>
<p id="id02065">I think she had spoken truth: the child of seven
was in the girl of seventeen.</p>
<p id="id02066">Graham looked after her a little baffled, a little
puzzled; his eye was on her a good deal during the rest of the
evening, but she did not seem to notice him.</p>
<p id="id02067">As we ascended to the drawing-room for tea, she
took her father's arm: her natural place seemed to be at his side;
her eyes and her ears were dedicated to him. He and Mrs. Bretton
were the chief talkers of our little party, and Paulina was their
best listener, attending closely to all that was said, prompting
the repetition of this or that trait or adventure.</p>
<p id="id02068">"And where were you at such a time, papa? And what
did you say then? And tell Mrs. Bretton what happened on that
occasion." Thus she drew him out.</p>
<p id="id02069">She did not again yield to any effervescence of
glee; the infantine sparkle was exhaled for the night: she was
soft, thoughtful, and docile. It was pretty to see her bid
good-night; her manner to Graham was touched with dignity: in her
very slight smile and quiet bow spoke the Countess, and Graham
could not but look grave, and bend responsive. I saw he hardly knew
how to blend together in his ideas the dancing fairy and delicate
dame.</p>
<p id="id02070">Next day, when we were all assembled round the
breakfast-table, shivering and fresh from the morning's chill
ablutions, Mrs. Bretton pronounced a decree that nobody, who was
not forced by dire necessity, should quit her house that day.</p>
<p id="id02071">Indeed, egress seemed next to impossible; the drift
darkened the lower panes of the casement, and, on looking out, one
saw the sky and air vexed and dim, the wind and snow in angry
conflict. There was no fall now, but what had already descended was
torn up from the earth, whirled round by brief shrieking gusts, and
cast into a hundred fantastic forms.</p>
<p id="id02072">The Countess seconded Mrs. Bretton.</p>
<p id="id02073">"Papa shall not go out," said she, placing a seat
for herself beside her father's arm-chair. "I will look after him.
You won't go into town, will you, papa?"</p>
<p id="id02074">"Ay, and No," was the answer. "If you and Mrs.
Bretton are <i>very</i> good to me, Polly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;kind,
you know, and attentive; if you pet me in a very nice manner, and
make much of me, I may possibly be induced to wait an hour after
breakfast and see whether this razor-edged wind settles. But, you
see, you give me no breakfast; you offer me nothing: you let me
starve."</p>
<p id="id02075">"Quick! please, Mrs. Bretton, and pour out the
coffee," entreated Paulina, "whilst I take care of the Count de
Bassompierre in other respects: since he grew into a Count, he has
needed <i>so</i> much attention."</p>
<p id="id02076">She separated and prepared a roll.</p>
<p id="id02077">"There, papa, are your 'pistolets' charged," said
she. "And there is<br />
some marmalade, just the same sort of marmalade we used to have
at<br />
Bretton, and which you said was as good as if it had been conserved
in<br />
Scotland&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"<br /></p>
<p id="id02078">"And which your little ladyship used to beg for my
boy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;do you remember that?" interposed Mrs.
Bretton. "Have you forgotten how you would come to my elbow and
touch my sleeve with the whisper, 'Please, ma'am, something good
for Graham&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a little marmalade, or honey, or
jam?"'</p>
<p id="id02079">"No, mamma," broke in Dr. John, laughing, yet
reddening; "it surely was not so: I could not have cared for these
things."</p>
<p id="id02080">"Did he or did he not, Paulina?"</p>
<p id="id02081">"He liked them," asserted Paulina.</p>
<p id="id02082">"Never blush for it, John," said Mr. Home,
encouragingly. "I like them myself yet, and always did. And Polly
showed her sense in catering for a friend's material comforts: it
was I who put her into the way of such good
manners&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nor do I let her forget them. Polly,
offer me a small slice of that tongue."</p>
<p id="id02083">"There, papa: but remember you are only waited upon
with this assiduity; on condition of being persuadable, and
reconciling yourself to La Terrasse for the day."</p>
<p id="id02084">"Mrs. Bretton," said the Count, "I want to get rid
of my daughter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to send her to school. Do you
know of any good school?"</p>
<p id="id02085">"There is Lucy's place&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Madame
Beck's."</p>
<p id="id02086">"Miss Snowe is in a school?"</p>
<p id="id02087">"I am a teacher," I said, and was rather glad of
the opportunity of saying this. For a little while I had been
feeling as if placed in a false position. Mrs. Bretton and son knew
my circumstances; but the Count and his daughter did not. They
might choose to vary by some shades their hitherto cordial manner
towards me, when aware of my grade in society. I spoke then
readily: but a swarm of thoughts I had not anticipated nor invoked,
rose dim at the words, making me sigh involuntarily. Mr. Home did
not lift his eyes from his breakfast-plate for about two minutes,
nor did he speak; perhaps he had not caught the
words&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps he thought that on a confession of
that nature, politeness would interdict comment: the Scotch are
proverbially proud; and homely as was Mr. Home in look, simple in
habits and tastes, I have all along intimated that he was not
without his share of the national quality. Was his a pseudo pride?
was it real dignity? I leave the question undecided in its wide
sense. Where it concerned me individually I can only answer: then,
and always, he showed himself a true-hearted gentleman.</p>
<p id="id02088">By nature he was a feeler and a thinker; over his
emotions and his reflections spread a mellowing of melancholy; more
than a mellowing: in trouble and bereavement it became a cloud. He
did not know much about Lucy Snowe; what he knew, he did not very
accurately comprehend: indeed his misconceptions of my character
often made me smile; but he saw my walk in life lay rather on the
shady side of the hill: he gave me credit for doing my endeavour to
keep the course honestly straight; he would have helped me if he
could: having no opportunity of helping, he still wished me well.
When he did look at me, his eye was kind; when he did speak, his
voice was benevolent.</p>
<p id="id02089">"Yours," said he, "is an arduous calling. I wish
you health and strength to win in
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;success."</p>
<p id="id02090">His fair little daughter did not take the
information quite so composedly: she fixed on me a pair of eyes
wide with wonder&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost with dismay.</p>
<p id="id02091">"Are you a teacher?" cried she. Then, having paused
on the unpalatable idea, "Well, I never knew what you were, nor
ever thought of asking: for me, you were always Lucy Snowe."</p>
<p id="id02092">"And what am I now?" I could not forbear
inquiring.</p>
<p id="id02093">"Yourself, of course. But do you really teach here,
in Villette?"</p>
<p id="id02094">"I really do."</p>
<p id="id02095">"And do you like it?"</p>
<p id="id02096">"Not always."</p>
<p id="id02097">"And why do you go on with it?"</p>
<p id="id02098">Her father looked at, and, I feared, was going to
check her; but he only said, "Proceed, Polly, proceed with that
catechism&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;prove yourself the little wiseacre you
are. If Miss Snowe were to blush and look confused, I should have
to bid you hold your tongue; and you and I would sit out the
present meal in some disgrace; but she only smiles, so push her
hard, multiply the cross-questions. Well, Miss Snowe, why do you go
on with it?"</p>
<p id="id02099">"Chiefly, I fear, for the sake of the money I
get."</p>
<p id="id02100">"Not then from motives of pure philanthropy? Polly
and I were clinging to that hypothesis as the most lenient way of
accounting for your eccentricity."</p>
<p id="id02101">"No&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no, sir. Rather for the roof
of shelter I am thus enabled to keep over my head; and for the
comfort of mind it gives me to think that while I can work for
myself, I am spared the pain of being a burden to anybody."</p>
<p id="id02102">"Papa, say what you will, I pity Lucy."</p>
<p id="id02103">"Take up that pity, Miss de Bassompierre; take it
up in both hands, as you might a little callow gosling squattering
out of bounds without leave; put it back in the warm nest of a
heart whence it issued, and receive in your ear this whisper. If my
Polly ever came to know by experience the uncertain nature of this
world's goods, I should like her to act as Lucy acts: to work for
herself, that she might burden neither kith nor kin."</p>
<p id="id02104">"Yes, papa," said she, pensively and tractably.
"But poor Lucy! I thought she was a rich lady, and had rich
friends."</p>
<p id="id02105">"You thought like a little simpleton. <i>I</i>
never thought so. When I had time to consider Lucy's manner and
aspect, which was not often, I saw she was one who had to guard and
not be guarded; to act and not be served: and this lot has, I
imagine, helped her to an experience for which, if she live long
enough to realize its full benefit, she may yet bless Providence.
But this school," he pursued, changing his tone from grave to gay:
"would Madame Beck admit my Polly, do you think, Miss Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id02106">I said, there needed but to try Madame; it would
soon be seen: she was fond of English pupils. "If you, sir," I
added, "will but take Miss de Bassompierre in your carriage this
very afternoon, I think I can answer for it that Rosine, the
portress, will not be very slow in answering your ring; and Madame,
I am sure, will put on her best pair of gloves to come into the
salon to receive you."</p>
<p id="id02107">"In that case," responded Mr. Home, "I see no sort
of necessity there is for delay. Mrs. Hurst can send what she calls
her young lady's 'things' after her; Polly can settle down to her
horn-book before night; and you, Miss Lucy, I trust, will not
disdain to cast an occasional eye upon her, and let me know, from
time to time, how she gets on. I hope you approve of the
arrangement, Countess de Bassompierre?"</p>
<p id="id02108">The Countess hemmed and hesitated. "I thought,"
said she, "I thought I had finished my
education&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02109">"That only proves how much we may be mistaken in
our thoughts I hold a far different opinion, as most of these will
who have been auditors of your profound knowledge of life this
morning. Ah, my little girl, thou hast much to learn; and papa
ought to have taught thee more than he has done! Come, there is
nothing for it but to try Madame Beck; and the weather seems
settling, and I have finished my breakfast&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02110">"But, papa!"</p>
<p id="id02111">"Well?"</p>
<p id="id02112">"I see an obstacle."</p>
<p id="id02113">"I don't at all."</p>
<p id="id02114">"It is enormous, papa; it can never be got over; it
is as large as you in your greatcoat, and the snowdrift on the
top."</p>
<p id="id02115">"And, like that snowdrift, capable of melting?"</p>
<p id="id02116">"No! it is of too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too solid
flesh: it is just your own self. Miss Lucy, warn Madame Beck not to
listen to any overtures about taking me, because, in the end, it
would turn out that she would have to take papa too: as he is so
teasing, I will just tell tales about him. Mrs. Bretton and all of
you listen: About five years ago, when I was twelve years old, he
took it into his head that he was spoiling me; that I was growing
unfitted for the world, and I don't know what, and nothing would
serve or satisfy him, but I must go to school. I cried, and so on;
but M. de Bassompierre proved hard-hearted, quite firm and flinty,
and to school I went. What was the result? In the most admirable
manner, papa came to school likewise: every other day he called to
see me. Madame Aigredoux grumbled, but it was of no use; and so, at
last, papa and I were both, in a manner, expelled. Lucy can just
tell Madame Beck this little trait: it is only fair to let her know
what she has to expect."</p>
<p id="id02117">Mrs. Bretton asked Mr. Home what he had to say in
answer to this statement. As he made no defence, judgment was given
against him, and Paulina triumphed.</p>
<p id="id02118">But she had other moods besides the arch and
na&Atilde;&macr;ve. After breakfast; when the two elders
withdrew&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I suppose to talk over certain of Mrs.
Bretton's business matters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and the Countess, Dr.
Bretton, and I, were for a short time alone
together&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all the child left her; with us, more
nearly her companions in age, she rose at once to the little lady:
her very face seemed to alter; that play of feature, and candour of
look, which, when she spoke to her father, made it quite dimpled
and round, yielded to an aspect more thoughtful, and lines
distincter and less <i>mobile</i>.</p>
<p id="id02119">No doubt Graham noted the change as well as I. He
stood for some minutes near the window, looking out at the snow;
presently he, approached the hearth, and entered into conversation,
but not quite with his usual ease: fit topics did not seem to rise
to his lips; he chose them fastidiously, hesitatingly, and
consequently infelicitously: he spoke vaguely of
Villette&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;its inhabitants, its notable sights and
buildings. He was answered by Miss de Bassompierre in quite womanly
sort; with intelligence, with a manner not indeed wholly
disindividualized: a tone, a glance, a gesture, here and there,
rather animated and quick than measured and stately, still recalled
little Polly; but yet there was so fine and even a polish, so calm
and courteous a grace, gilding and sustaining these peculiarities,
that a less sensitive man than Graham would not have ventured to
seize upon them as vantage points, leading to franker intimacy.</p>
<p id="id02120">Yet while Dr. Bretton continued subdued, and, for
him, sedate, he was still observant. Not one of those petty
impulses and natural breaks escaped him. He did not miss one
characteristic movement, one hesitation in language, or one lisp in
utterance. At times, in speaking fast, she still lisped; but
coloured whenever such lapse occurred, and in a painstaking,
conscientious manner, quite as amusing as the slight error,
repeated the word more distinctly.</p>
<p id="id02121">Whenever she did this, Dr. Bretton smiled.
Gradually, as they conversed, the restraint on each side slackened:
might the conference have but been prolonged, I believe it would
soon have become genial: already to Paulina's lip and cheek
returned the wreathing, dimpling smile; she lisped once, and forgot
to correct herself. And Dr. John, I know not how <i>he</i> changed,
but change he did. He did not grow gayer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no
raillery, no levity sparkled across his
aspect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but his position seemed to become one of
more pleasure to himself, and he spoke his augmented comfort in
readier language, in tones more suave. Ten years ago this pair had
always found abundance to say to each other; the intervening decade
had not narrowed the experience or impoverished the intelligence of
either: besides, there are certain natures of which the mutual
influence is such, that the more they say, the more they have to
say. For these out of association grows adhesion, and out of
adhesion, amalgamation.</p>
<p id="id02122">Graham, however, must go: his was a profession
whose claims are neither to be ignored nor deferred. He left the
room; but before he could leave the house there was a return. I am
sure he came back&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not for the paper, or card in
his desk, which formed his ostensible errand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but
to assure himself, by one more glance, that Paulina's aspect was
really such as memory was bearing away: that he had not been
viewing her somehow by a partial, artificial light, and making a
fond mistake. No! he found the impression
true&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rather, indeed, he gained than lost by this
return: he took away with him a parting
look&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shy, but very soft&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as
beautiful, as innocent, as any little fawn could lift out of its
cover of fern, or any lamb from its meadow-bed.</p>
<p id="id02123">Being left alone, Paulina and I kept silence for
some time: we both took out some work, and plied a mute and
diligent task. The white-wood workbox of old days was now replaced
by one inlaid with precious mosaic, and furnished with implements
of gold; the tiny and trembling fingers that could scarce guide the
needle, though tiny still, were now swift and skilful: but there
was the same busy knitting of the brow, the same little dainty
mannerisms, the same quick turns and
movements&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;now to replace a stray tress, and anon
to shake from the silken skirt some imaginary atom of
dust&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some clinging fibre of thread.</p>
<p id="id02124">That morning I was disposed for silence: the
austere fury of the winter-day had on me an awing, hushing
influence. That passion of January, so white and so bloodless, was
not yet spent: the storm had raved itself hoarse, but seemed no
nearer exhaustion. Had Ginevra Fanshawe been my companion in that
drawing-room, she would not have suffered me to muse and listen
undisturbed. The presence just gone from us would have been her
theme; and how she would have rung the changes on one topic! how
she would have pursued and pestered me with questions and
surmises&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;worried and oppressed me with comments
and confidences I did not want, and longed to avoid.</p>
<p id="id02125">Paulina Mary cast once or twice towards me a quiet
but penetrating glance of her dark, full eye; her lips half opened,
as if to the impulse of coming utterance: but she saw and
delicately respected my inclination for silence.</p>
<p id="id02126">"This will not hold long," I thought to myself; for
I was not accustomed to find in women or girls any power of
self-control, or strength of self-denial. As far as I knew them,
the chance of a gossip about their usually trivial secrets, their
often very washy and paltry feelings, was a treat not to be readily
foregone.</p>
<p id="id02127">The little Countess promised an exception: she
sewed till she was tired of sewing, and then she took a book.</p>
<p id="id02128">As chance would have it, she had sought it in Dr.
Bretton's own compartment of the bookcase; and it proved to be an
old Bretton book&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some illustrated work of
natural history. Often had I seen her standing at Graham's side,
resting that volume on his knee, and reading to his tuition; and,
when the lesson was over, begging, as a treat, that he would tell
her all about the pictures. I watched her keenly: here was a true
test of that memory she had boasted would her recollections now be
faithful?</p>
<p id="id02129">Faithful? It could not be doubted. As she turned
the leaves, over her face passed gleam after gleam of expression,
the least intelligent of which was a full greeting to the Past. And
then she turned to the title-page, and looked at the name written
in the schoolboy hand. She looked at it long; nor was she satisfied
with merely looking: she gently passed over the characters the tips
of her fingers, accompanying the action with an unconscious but
tender smile, which converted the touch into a caress. Paulina
loved the Past; but the peculiarity of this little scene was, that
she <i>said</i> nothing: she could feel without pouring out her
feelings in a flux of words.</p>
<p id="id02130">She now occupied herself at the bookcase for nearly
an hour; taking down volume after volume, and renewing her
acquaintance with each. This done, she seated herself on a low
stool, rested her cheek on her hand, and thought, and still was
mute.</p>
<p id="id02131">The sound of the front door opened below, a rush of
cold wind, and her father's voice speaking to Mrs. Bretton in the
hall, startled her at last. She sprang up: she was down-stairs in
one second.</p>
<p id="id02132">"Papa! papa! you are not going out?"</p>
<p id="id02133">"My pet, I must go into town."</p>
<p id="id02134">"But it is too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>too</i> cold,
papa."</p>
<p id="id02135">And then I heard M. de Bassompierre showing to her
how he was well provided against the weather; and how he was going
to have the carriage, and to be quite snugly sheltered; and, in
short, proving that she need not fear for his comfort.</p>
<p id="id02136">"But you will promise to come back here this
evening, before it is quite dark;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you and Dr.
Bretton, both, in the carriage? It is not fit to ride."</p>
<p id="id02137">"Well, if I see the Doctor, I will tell him a lady
has laid on him her commands to take care of his precious health
and come home early under my escort."</p>
<p id="id02138">"Yes, you must say a lady; and he will think it is
his mother, and be obedient And, papa, mind to come soon, for I
<i>shall</i> watch and listen."</p>
<p id="id02139">The door closed, and the carriage rolled softly
through the snow; and back returned the Countess, pensive and
anxious.</p>
<p id="id02140">She <i>did</i> listen, and watch, when evening
closed; but it was in stillest sort: walking the drawing-room with
quite noiseless step. She checked at intervals her velvet march;
inclined her ear, and consulted the night sounds: I should rather
say, the night silence; for now, at last, the wind was fallen. The
sky, relieved of its avalanche, lay naked and pale: through the
barren boughs of the avenue we could see it well, and note also the
polar splendour of the new-year moon&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an orb
white as a world of ice. Nor was it late when we saw also the
return of the carriage.</p>
<p id="id02141">Paulina had no dance of welcome for this evening.
It was with a sort of gravity that she took immediate possession of
her father, as he entered the room; but she at once made him her
entire property, led him to the seat of her choice, and, while
softly showering round him honeyed words of commendation for being
so good and coming home so soon, you would have thought it was
entirely by the power of her little hands he was put into his
chair, and settled and arranged; for the strong man seemed to take
pleasure in wholly yielding himself to this dominion-potent only by
love.</p>
<p id="id02142">Graham did not appear till some minutes after the
Count. Paulina half turned when his step was heard: they spoke, but
only a word or two; their fingers met a moment, but obviously with
slight contact. Paulina remained beside her father; Graham threw
himself into a seat on the other side of the room.</p>
<p id="id02143">It was well that Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home had a
great deal to say to each other-almost an inexhaustible fund of
discourse in old recollections; otherwise, I think, our party would
have been but a still one that evening.</p>
<p id="id02144">After tea, Paulina's quick needle and pretty golden
thimble were busily plied by the lamp-light, but her tongue rested,
and her eyes seemed reluctant to raise often their lids, so smooth
and so full-fringed. Graham, too, must have been tired with his
day's work: he listened dutifully to his elders and betters, said
very little himself, and followed with his eye the gilded glance of
Paulina's thimble; as if it had been some bright moth on the wing,
or the golden head of some darting little yellow serpent.</p>
<h2 id="id02145" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h5 id="id02146">A BURIAL.</h5>
<p id="id02147" style="margin-top: 2em">From this date my life did
not want variety; I went out a good deal, with the entire consent
of Madame Beck, who perfectly approved the grade of my
acquaintance. That worthy directress had never from the first
treated me otherwise than with respect; and when she found that I
was liable to frequent invitations from a ch&Atilde;&cent;teau and
a great hotel, respect improved into distinction.</p>
<p id="id02148">Not that she was fulsome about it: Madame, in all
things worldly, was in nothing weak; there was measure and sense in
her hottest pursuit of self-interest, calm and considerateness in
her closest clutch of gain; without, then, laying herself open to
my contempt as a time-server and a toadie, she marked with tact
that she was pleased people connected with her establishment should
frequent such associates as must cultivate and elevate, rather than
those who might deteriorate and depress. She never praised either
me or my friends; only once when she was sitting in the sun in the
garden, a cup of coffee at her elbow and the Gazette in her hand,
looking very comfortable, and I came up and asked leave of absence
for the evening, she delivered herself in this gracious
sort:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02149">"Oui, oui, ma bonne amie: je vous donne la
permission de coeur et de gr&Atilde;&copy;. Votre travail dans ma
maison a toujours &Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; admirable, rempli
de z&Atilde;&uml;le et de discr&Atilde;&copy;tion: vous avez bien
le droit de vous amuser. Sortez donc tant que vous voudrez. Quant
&Atilde;&nbsp; votre choix de connaissances, j'en suis contente;
c'est sage, digne, laudable."</p>
<p id="id02150">She closed her lips and resumed the Gazette.</p>
<p id="id02151">The reader will not too gravely regard the little
circumstance that about this time the triply-enclosed packet of
five letters temporarily disappeared from my bureau. Blank dismay
was naturally my first sensation on making the discovery; but in a
moment I took heart of grace.</p>
<p id="id02152">"Patience!" whispered I to myself. "Let me say
nothing, but wait peaceably; they will come back again."</p>
<p id="id02153">And they did come back: they had only been on a
short visit to Madame's chamber; having passed their examination,
they came back duly and truly: I found them all right the next
day.</p>
<p id="id02154">I wonder what she thought of my correspondence?
What estimate did she form of Dr. John Bretton's epistolary powers?
In what light did the often very pithy thoughts, the generally
sound, and sometimes original opinions, set, without pretension, in
an easily-flowing, spirited style, appear to her? How did she like
that genial, half humorous vein, which to me gave such delight?
What did she think of the few kind words scattered here and
there-not thickly, as the diamonds were scattered in the valley of
Sindbad, but sparely, as those gems lie in unfabled beds? Oh,
Madame Beck! how seemed these things to you?</p>
<p id="id02155">I think in Madame Beck's eyes the five letters
found a certain favour. One day after she had <i>borrowed</i> them
of me (in speaking of so suave a little woman, one ought to use
suave terms), I caught her examining me with a steady contemplative
gaze, a little puzzled, but not at all malevolent. It was during
that brief space between lessons, when the pupils turned out into
the court for a quarter of an hour's recreation; she and I remained
in the first classe alone: when I met her eye, her thoughts forced
themselves partially through her lips.</p>
<p id="id02156">"Il y a," said she, "quelquechose de bien
remarquable dans le caract&Atilde;&uml;re<br />
Anglais."<br /></p>
<p id="id02157">"How, Madame?"</p>
<p id="id02158">She gave a little laugh, repeating the word "how"
in English.</p>
<p id="id02159">"Je ne saurais vous dire 'how;' mais, enfin, les
Anglais ont des id&Atilde;&copy;es &Atilde;&nbsp; eux, en
amiti&Atilde;&copy;, en amour, en tout. Mais au moins il n'est pas
besoin de les surveiller," she added, getting up and trotting away
like the compact little pony she was.</p>
<p id="id02160">"Then I hope," murmured I to myself, "you will
graciously let alone my letters for the future."</p>
<p id="id02161">Alas! something came rushing into my eyes, dimming
utterly their vision, blotting from sight the schoolroom, the
garden, the bright winter sun, as I remembered that never more
would letters, such as she had read, come to me. I had seen the
last of them. That goodly river on whose banks I had sojourned, of
whose waves a few reviving drops had trickled to my lips, was
bending to another course: it was leaving my little hut and field
forlorn and sand-dry, pouring its wealth of waters far away. The
change was right, just, natural; not a word could be said: but I
loved my Rhine, my Nile; I had almost worshipped my Ganges, and I
grieved that the grand tide should roll estranged, should vanish
like a false mirage. Though stoical, I was not quite a stoic; drops
streamed fast on my hands, on my desk: I wept one sultry shower,
heavy and brief.</p>
<p id="id02162">But soon I said to myself, "The Hope I am bemoaning
suffered and made me suffer much: it did not die till it was full
time: following an agony so lingering, death ought to be
welcome."</p>
<p id="id02163">Welcome I endeavoured to make it. Indeed, long pain
had made patience a habit. In the end I closed the eyes of my dead,
covered its face, and composed its limbs with great calm.</p>
<p id="id02164">The letters, however, must be put away, out of
sight: people who have undergone bereavement always jealously
gather together and lock away mementos: it is not supportable to be
stabbed to the heart each moment by sharp revival of regret.</p>
<p id="id02165">One vacant holiday afternoon (the Thursday) going
to my treasure, with intent to consider its final disposal, I
perceived&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and this time with a strong impulse of
displeasure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that it had been again tampered
with: the packet was there, indeed, but the ribbon which secured it
had been untied and retied; and by other symptoms I knew that my
drawer had been visited.</p>
<p id="id02166">This was a little too much. Madame Beck herself was
the soul of discretion, besides having as strong a brain and sound
a judgment as ever furnished a human head; that she should know the
contents of my casket, was not pleasant, but might be borne. Little
Jesuit inquisitress as she was, she could see things in a true
light, and understand them in an unperverted sense; but the idea
that she had ventured to communicate information, thus gained, to
others; that she had, perhaps, amused herself with a companion over
documents, in my eyes most sacred, shocked me cruelly. Yet, that
such was the case I now saw reason to fear; I even guessed her
confidant. Her kinsman, M. Paul Emanuel, had spent yesterday
evening with her: she was much in the habit of consulting him, and
of discussing with him matters she broached to no one else. This
very morning, in class, that gentleman had favoured me with a
glance which he seemed to have borrowed from Vashti, the actress; I
had not at the moment comprehended that blue, yet lurid, flash out
of his angry eye; but I read its meaning now. <i>He</i>, I
believed, was not apt to regard what concerned me from a fair point
of view, nor to judge me with tolerance and candour: I had always
found him severe and suspicious: the thought that these letters,
mere friendly letters as they were, had fallen once, and might fall
again, into his hands, jarred my very soul.</p>
<p id="id02167">What should I do to prevent this? In what corner of
this strange house was it possible to find security or secresy?
Where could a key be a safeguard, or a padlock a barrier?</p>
<p id="id02168">In the grenier? No, I did not like the grenier.
Besides, most of the boxes and drawers there were mouldering, and
did not lock. Rats, too, gnawed their way through the decayed wood;
and mice made nests amongst the litter of their contents: my dear
letters (most dear still, though Ichabod was written on their
covers) might be consumed by vermin; certainly the writing would
soon become obliterated by damp. No; the grenier would not
do&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but where then?</p>
<p id="id02169">While pondering this problem, I sat in the
dormitory window-seat. It was a fine frosty afternoon; the winter
sun, already setting, gleamed pale on the tops of the garden-shrubs
in the "all&Atilde;&copy;e d&Atilde;&copy;fendue." One great old
pear-tree&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the nun's
pear-tree&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stood up a tall dryad skeleton, grey,
gaunt, and stripped. A thought struck me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one of
those queer fantastic thoughts that will sometimes strike solitary
people. I put on my bonnet, cloak, and furs, and went out into the
city.</p>
<p id="id02170">Bending my steps to the old historical quarter of
the town, whose hoax and overshadowed precincts I always sought by
instinct in melancholy moods, I wandered on from street to street,
till, having crossed a half deserted "place" or square, I found
myself before a sort of broker's shop; an ancient place, full of
ancient things. What I wanted was a metal box which might be
soldered, or a thick glass jar or bottle which might be stoppered
or sealed hermetically. Amongst miscellaneous heaps, I found and
purchased the latter article.</p>
<p id="id02171">I then made a little roll of my letters, wrapped
them in oiled silk, bound them with twine, and, having put them in
the bottle, got the old Jew broker to stopper, seal, and make it
air-tight. While obeying my directions, he glanced at me now and
then suspiciously from under his frost-white eyelashes. I believe
he thought there was some evil deed on hand. In all this I had a
dreary something&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not
pleasure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but a sad, lonely satisfaction. The
impulse under which I acted, the mood controlling me, were similar
to the impulse and the mood which had induced me to visit the
confessional. With quick walking I regained the pensionnat just at
dark, and in time for dinner.</p>
<p id="id02172">At seven o'clock the moon rose. At half-past seven,
when the pupils and teachers were at study, and Madame Beck was
with her mother and children in the salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger,
when the half-boarders were all gone home, and Rosine had left the
vestibule, and all was still&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I shawled myself,
and, taking the sealed jar, stole out through the first-classe
door, into the berceau and thence into the "all&Atilde;&copy;e
d&Atilde;&copy;fendue."</p>
<p id="id02173">Methusaleh, the pear-tree, stood at the further end
of this walk, near my seat: he rose up, dim and gray, above the
lower shrubs round him. Now Methusaleh, though so very old, was of
sound timber still; only there was a hole, or rather a deep hollow,
near his root. I knew there was such a hollow, hidden partly by ivy
and creepers growing thick round; and there I meditated hiding my
treasure. But I was not only going to hide a
treasure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I meant also to bury a grief. That
grief over which I had lately been weeping, as I wrapped it in its
winding-sheet, must be interred.</p>
<p id="id02174">Well, I cleared away the ivy, and found the hole;
it was large enough to receive the jar, and I thrust it deep in. In
a tool-shed at the bottom of the garden, lay the relics of
building-materials, left by masons lately employed to repair a part
of the premises. I fetched thence a slate and some mortar, put the
slate on the hollow, secured it with cement, covered the hole with
black mould, and, finally, replaced the ivy. This done, I rested,
leaning against the tree; lingering, like any other mourner, beside
a newly-sodded grave.</p>
<p id="id02175">The air of the night was very still, but dim with a
peculiar mist, which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze. In
this air, or this mist, there was some
quality&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;electrical,
perhaps&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which acted in strange sort upon me. I
felt then as I had felt a year ago in England&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on
a night when the aurora borealis was streaming and sweeping round
heaven, when, belated in lonely fields, I had paused to watch that
mustering of an army with banners&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that quivering
of serried lances&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that swift ascent of
messengers from below the north star to the dark, high keystone of
heaven's arch. I felt, not happy, far otherwise, but strong with
reinforced strength.</p>
<p id="id02176">If life be a war, it seemed my destiny to conduct
it single-handed. I pondered now how to break up my
winter-quarters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to leave an encampment where
food and forage failed. Perhaps, to effect this change, another
pitched battle must be fought with fortune; if so, I had a mind to
the encounter: too poor to lose, God might destine me to gain. But
what road was open?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what plan available?</p>
<p id="id02177">On this question I was still pausing, when the
moon, so dim hitherto, seemed to shine out somewhat brighter: a ray
gleamed even white before me, and a shadow became distinct and
marked. I looked more narrowly, to make out the cause of this
well-defined contrast appearing a little suddenly in the obscure
alley: whiter and blacker it grew on my eye: it took shape with
instantaneous transformation. I stood about three yards from a
tall, sable-robed, snowy-veiled woman.</p>
<p id="id02178">Five minutes passed. I neither fled nor shrieked.
She was there still.<br />
I spoke.<br /></p>
<p id="id02179">"Who are you? and why do you come to me?"</p>
<p id="id02180">She stood mute. She had no
face&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no features: all below her brow was masked
with a white cloth; but she had eyes, and they viewed me.</p>
<p id="id02181">I felt, if not brave, yet a little desperate; and
desperation will often suffice to fill the post and do the work of
courage. I advanced one step. I stretched out my hand, for I meant
to touch her. She seemed to recede. I drew nearer: her recession,
still silent, became swift. A mass of shrubs, full-leaved
evergreens, laurel and dense yew, intervened between me and what I
followed. Having passed that obstacle, I looked and saw nothing. I
waited. I said,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"If you have any errand to men,
come back and deliver it." Nothing spoke or re-appeared.</p>
<p id="id02182">This time there was no Dr. John to whom to have
recourse: there was no one to whom I dared whisper the words, "I
have again seen the nun."</p>
<p id="id02183">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id02184">Paulina Mary sought my frequent presence in the Rue
Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy. In the old Bretton days, though she had never
professed herself fond of me, my society had soon become to her a
sort of unconscious necessary. I used to notice that if I withdrew
to my room, she would speedily come trotting after me, and opening
the door and peeping in, say, with her little peremptory
accent,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Come down. Why do you sit here by
yourself? You must come into the parlour."</p>
<p id="id02185">In the same spirit she urged me
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Leave the Rue Fossette," she said, "and
come and live with us. Papa would give you far more than Madame
Beck gives you."</p>
<p id="id02186">Mr. Home himself offered me a handsome
sum&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;thrice my present
salary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if I would accept the office of companion
to his daughter. I declined. I think I should have declined had I
been poorer than I was, and with scantier fund of resource, more
stinted narrowness of future prospect. I had not that vocation. I
could teach; I could give lessons; but to be either a private
governess or a companion was unnatural to me. Rather than fill the
former post in any great house, I would deliberately have taken a
housemaid's place, bought a strong pair of gloves, swept bedrooms
and staircases, and cleaned stoves and locks, in peace and
independence. Rather than be a companion, I would have made shirts
and starved.</p>
<p id="id02187">I was no bright lady's
shadow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not Miss de Bassompierre's. Overcast
enough it was my nature often to be; of a subdued habit I was: but
the dimness and depression must both be
voluntary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such as kept me docile at my desk, in
the midst of my now well-accustomed pupils in Madame Beck's fist
classe; or alone, at my own bedside, in her dormitory, or in the
alley and seat which were called mine, in her garden: my
qualifications were not convertible, nor adaptable; they could not
be made the foil of any gem, the adjunct of any beauty, the
appendage of any greatness in Christendom. Madame Beck and I,
without assimilating, understood each other well. I was not
<i>her</i> companion, nor her children's governess; she left me
free: she tied me to nothing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not to
herself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not even to her interests: once, when
she had for a fortnight been called from home by a near relation's
illness, and on her return, all anxious and full of care about her
establishment, lest something in her absence should have gone wrong
finding that matters had proceeded much as usual, and that there
was no evidence of glaring neglect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she made each
of the teachers a present, in acknowledgment of steadiness. To my
bedside she came at twelve o'clock at night, and told me she had no
present for me: "I must make fidelity advantageous to the St.
Pierre," said she; "if I attempt to make it advantageous to you,
there will arise misunderstanding between
us&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps separation. One thing, however, I
<i>can</i> do to please you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;leave you alone with
your liberty: c'est-ce que je ferai." She kept her word. Every
slight shackle she had ever laid on me, she, from that time, with
quiet hand removed. Thus I had pleasure in voluntarily respecting
her rules: gratification in devoting double time, in taking double
pains with the pupils she committed to my charge.</p>
<p id="id02188">As to Mary de Bassompierre, I visited her with
pleasure, though I would not live with her. My visits soon taught
me that it was unlikely even my occasional and voluntary society
would long be indispensable to her. M. de Bassompierre, for his
part, seemed impervious to this conjecture, blind to this
possibility; unconscious as any child to the signs, the
likelihoods, the fitful beginnings of what, when it drew to an end,
he might not approve.</p>
<p id="id02189">Whether or not he would cordially approve, I used
to speculate. Difficult to say. He was much taken up with
scientific interests; keen, intent, and somewhat oppugnant in what
concerned his favourite pursuits, but unsuspicious and trustful in
the ordinary affairs of life. From all I could gather, he seemed to
regard his "daughterling" as still but a child, and probably had
not yet admitted the notion that others might look on her in a
different light: he would speak of what should be done when "Polly"
was a woman, when she should be grown up; and "Polly," standing
beside his chair, would sometimes smile and take his honoured head
between her little hands, and kiss his iron-grey locks; and, at
other times, she would pout and toss her curls: but she never said,
"Papa, I <i>am</i> grown up."</p>
<p id="id02190">She had different moods for different people. With
her father she really was still a child, or child-like,
affectionate, merry, and playful. With me she was serious, and as
womanly as thought and feeling could make her. With Mrs. Bretton
she was docile and reliant, but not expansive. With Graham she was
shy, at present very shy; at moments she tried to be cold; on
occasion she endeavoured to shun him. His step made her start; his
entrance hushed her; when he spoke, her answers failed of fluency;
when he took leave, she remained self-vexed and disconcerted. Even
her father noticed this demeanour in her.</p>
<p id="id02191">"My little Polly," he said once, "you live too
retired a life; if you grow to be a woman with these shy manners,
you will hardly be fitted for society. You really make quite a
stranger of Dr. Bretton: how is this? Don't you remember that, as a
little girl, you used to be rather partial to him?"</p>
<p id="id02192">"<i>Rather</i>, papa," echoed she, with her
slightly dry, yet gentle and simple tone.</p>
<p id="id02193">"And you don't like him now? What has he done?"</p>
<p id="id02194">"Nothing.
Y&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;e&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;s, I like him a little;
but we are grown strange to each other."</p>
<p id="id02195">"Then rub it off, Polly; rub the rust and the
strangeness off. Talk away when he is here, and have no fear of
him?"</p>
<p id="id02196">"<i>He</i> does not talk much. Is he afraid of me,
do you think, papa?"</p>
<p id="id02197">"Oh, to be sure, what man would not be afraid of
such a little silent lady?"</p>
<p id="id02198">"Then tell him some day not to mind my being
silent. Say that it is my way, and that I have no unfriendly
intention."</p>
<p id="id02199">"Your way, you little chatter-box? So far from
being your way, it is only your whim!"</p>
<p id="id02200">"Well, I'll improve, papa."</p>
<p id="id02201">And very pretty was the grace with which, the next
day, she tried to keep her word. I saw her make the effort to
converse affably with Dr. John on general topics. The attention
called into her guest's face a pleasurable glow; he met her with
caution, and replied to her in his softest tones, as if there was a
kind of gossamer happiness hanging in the air which he feared to
disturb by drawing too deep a breath. Certainly, in her timid yet
earnest advance to friendship, it could not be denied that there
was a most exquisite and fairy charm.</p>
<p id="id02202">When the Doctor was gone, she approached her
father's chair.</p>
<p id="id02203">"Did I keep my word, papa? Did I behave
better?"</p>
<p id="id02204">"My Polly behaved like a queen. I shall become
quite proud of her if this improvement continues. By-and-by we
shall see her receiving my guests with quite a calm, grand manner.
Miss Lucy and I will have to look about us, and polish up all our
best airs and graces lest we should be thrown into the shade.
Still, Polly, there is a little flutter, a little tendency to
stammer now and then, and even, to lisp as you lisped when you were
six years old."</p>
<p id="id02205">"No, papa," interrupted she indignantly, "that
can't be true."</p>
<p id="id02206">"I appeal to Miss Lucy. Did she not, in answering
Dr. Bretton's question as to whether she had ever seen the palace
of the Prince of Bois l'Etang, say, 'yeth,' she had been there
'theveral' times?"</p>
<p id="id02207">"Papa, you are satirical, you are
m&Atilde;&copy;chant! I can pronounce all the letters of the
alphabet as clearly as you can. But tell me this you are very
particular in making me be civil to Dr. Bretton, do you like him
yourself?"</p>
<p id="id02208">"To be sure: for old acquaintance sake I like him:
then he is a very good son to his mother; besides being a
kind-hearted fellow and clever in his profession: yes, the callant
is well enough."</p>
<p id="id02209">"<i>Callant</i>! Ah, Scotchman! Papa, is it the
Edinburgh or the Aberdeen accent you have?"</p>
<p id="id02210">"Both, my pet, both: and doubtless the Glaswegian
into the bargain. It is that which enables me to speak French so
well: a gude Scots tongue always succeeds well at the French."</p>
<p id="id02211">"<i>The</i> French! Scotch again: incorrigible
papa. You, too, need schooling."</p>
<p id="id02212">"Well, Polly, you must persuade Miss Snowe to
undertake both you and me; to make you steady and womanly, and me
refined and classical."</p>
<p id="id02213">The light in which M. de Bassompierre evidently
regarded "Miss Snowe," used to occasion me much inward edification.
What contradictory attributes of character we sometimes find
ascribed to us, according to the eye with which we are viewed!
Madame Beck esteemed me learned and blue; Miss Fanshawe, caustic,
ironic, and cynical; Mr. Home, a model teacher, the essence of the
sedate and discreet: somewhat conventional, perhaps, too strict,
limited, and scrupulous, but still the pink and pattern of
governess-correctness; whilst another person, Professor Paul
Emanuel, to wit, never lost an opportunity of intimating his
opinion that mine was rather a fiery and rash
nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;adventurous, indocile, and audacious. I
smiled at them all. If any one knew me it was little Paulina
Mary.</p>
<p id="id02214">As I would not be Paulina's nominal and paid
companion, genial and harmonious as I began to find her
intercourse, she persuaded me to join her in some study, as a
regular and settled means of sustaining communication: she proposed
the German language, which, like myself, she found difficult of
mastery. We agreed to take our lessons in the Rue
Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy of the same mistress; this arrangement threw us
together for some hours of every week. M. de Bassompierre seemed
quite pleased: it perfectly met his approbation, that Madame
Minerva Gravity should associate a portion of her leisure with that
of his fair and dear child.</p>
<p id="id02215">That other self-elected judge of mine, the
professor in the Rue Fossette, discovering by some surreptitious
spying means, that I was no longer so stationary as hitherto, but
went out regularly at certain hours of certain days, took it upon
himself to place me under surveillance. People said M. Emanuel had
been brought up amongst Jesuits. I should more readily have
accredited this report had his manoeuvres been better masked. As it
was, I doubted it. Never was a more undisguised schemer, a franker,
looser intriguer. He would analyze his own machinations:
elaborately contrive plots, and forthwith indulge in explanatory
boasts of their skill. I know not whether I was more amused or
provoked, by his stepping up to me one morning and whispering
solemnly that he "had his eye on me: <i>he</i> at least would
discharge the duty of a friend, and not leave me entirely to my own
devices. My, proceedings seemed at present very unsettled: he did
not know what to make of them: he thought his cousin Beck very much
to blame in suffering this sort of fluttering inconsistency in a
teacher attached to her house. What had a person devoted to a
serious calling, that of education, to do with Counts and
Countesses, hotels and ch&Atilde;&cent;teaux? To him, I seemed
altogether 'en l'air.' On his faith, he believed I went out six
days in the seven."</p>
<p id="id02216">I said, "Monsieur exaggerated. I certainly had
enjoyed the advantage of a little change lately, but not before it
had become necessary; and the privilege was by no means exercised
in excess."</p>
<p id="id02217">"Necessary! How was it necessary? I was well
enough, he supposed? Change necessary! He would recommend me to
look at the Catholic 'religieuses,' and study <i>their</i> lives.
<i>They</i> asked no change."</p>
<p id="id02218">I am no judge of what expression crossed my face
when he thus spoke, but it was one which provoked him: he accused
me of being reckless, worldly, and epicurean; ambitious of
greatness, and feverishly athirst for the pomps and vanities of
life. It seems I had no "d&Atilde;&copy;vouement," no
"r&Atilde;&copy;cueillement" in my character; no spirit of grace,
faith, sacrifice, or self-abasement. Feeling the inutility of
answering these charges, I mutely continued the correction of a
pile of English exercises.</p>
<p id="id02219">"He could see in me nothing Christian: like many
other Protestants, I revelled in the pride and self-will of
paganism."</p>
<p id="id02220">I slightly turned from him, nestling still closer
under the wing of silence.</p>
<p id="id02221">A vague sound grumbled between his teeth; it could
not surely be a "juron:" he was too religious for that; but I am
certain I heard the word <i>sacr&Atilde;&copy;</i>. Grievous to
relate, the same word was repeated, with the unequivocal addition
of <i>mille</i> something, when I passed him about two hours
afterwards in the corridor, prepared to go and take my German
lesson in the Rue Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy. Never was a better little
man, in some points, than M. Paul: never, in others, a more waspish
little despot.</p>
<p id="id02222">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id02223">Our German mistress, Fr&Atilde;&curren;ulein Anna
Braun, was a worthy, hearty woman, of about forty-five; she ought,
perhaps, to have lived in the days of Queen Elizabeth, as she
habitually consumed, for her first and second breakfasts, beer and
beef: also, her direct and downright Deutsch nature seemed to
suffer a sensation of cruel restraint from what she called our
English reserve; though we thought we were very cordial with her:
but we did not slap her on the shoulder, and if we consented to
kiss her cheek, it was done quietly, and without any explosive
smack. These omissions oppressed and depressed her considerably;
still, on the whole, we got on very well. Accustomed to instruct
foreign girls, who hardly ever will think and study for
themselves&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who have no idea of grappling with a
difficulty, and overcoming it by dint of reflection or
application&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;our progress, which in truth was
very leisurely, seemed to astound her. In her eyes, we were a pair
of glacial prodigies, cold, proud, and preternatural.</p>
<p id="id02224">The young Countess <i>was</i> a little proud, a
little fastidious: and perhaps, with her native delicacy and
beauty, she had a right to these feelings; but I think it was a
total mistake to ascribe them to me. I never evaded the morning
salute, which Paulina would slip when she could; nor was a certain
little manner of still disdain a weapon known in my armoury of
defence; whereas, Paulina always kept it clear, fine, and bright,
and any rough German sally called forth at once its steelly
glisten.</p>
<p id="id02225">Honest Anna Braun, in some measure, felt this
difference; and while she half-feared, half-worshipped Paulina, as
a sort of dainty nymph&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an
Undine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she took refuge with me, as a being all
mortal, and of easier mood.</p>
<p id="id02226">A book we liked well to read and translate was
Schiller's Ballads; Paulina soon learned to read them beautifully;
the Fr&Atilde;&curren;ulein would listen to her with a broad smile
of pleasure, and say her voice sounded like music. She translated
them, too, with a facile flow of language, and in a strain of
kindred and poetic fervour: her cheek would flush, her lips
tremblingly smile, her beauteous eyes kindle or melt as she went
on. She learnt the best by heart, and would often recite them when
we were alone together. One she liked well was "Des
M&Atilde;&curren;dchens Klage:" that is, she liked well to repeat
the words, she found plaintive melody in the sound; the sense she
would criticise. She murmured, as we sat over the fire one
evening:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02227">&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Du Heilige, rufe dein
Kind zur&Atilde;&frac14;ck,<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Ich habe genossen das irdische
Gl&Atilde;&frac14;ck,<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;Ich habe gelebt
und geliebet!<br /></p>
<p id="id02228">"Lived and loved!" said she, "is that the summit of
earthly happiness, the end of life&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to love? I
don't think it is. It may be the extreme of mortal misery, it may
be sheer waste of time, and fruitless torture of feeling. If
Schiller had said to <i>be</i> loved, he might have come nearer the
truth. Is not that another thing, Lucy, to be loved?"</p>
<p id="id02229">"I suppose it may be: but why consider the subject?
What is love to you? What do you know about it?"</p>
<p id="id02230">She crimsoned, half in irritation, half in
shame.</p>
<p id="id02231">"Now, Lucy," she said, "I won't take that from you.
It may be well for papa to look on me as a baby: I rather prefer
that he should thus view me; but <i>you</i> know and shall learn to
acknowledge that I am verging on my nineteenth year."</p>
<p id="id02232">"No matter if it were your twenty-ninth; we will
anticipate no feelings by discussion and conversation; we will not
talk about love."</p>
<p id="id02233">"Indeed, indeed!" said she&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all
in hurry and heat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"you may think to check and
hold me in, as much as you please; but I <i>have</i> talked about
it, and heard about it too; and a great deal and lately, and
disagreeably and detrimentally: and in a way you wouldn't
approve."</p>
<p id="id02234">And the vexed, triumphant, pretty, naughty being
laughed. I could not discern what she meant, and I would not ask
her: I was nonplussed. Seeing, however, the utmost innocence in her
countenance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;combined with some transient
perverseness and petulance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I said at
last,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02235">"Who talks to you disagreeably and detrimentally on
such matters? Who that has near access to you would dare to do
it?"</p>
<p id="id02236">"Lucy," replied she more softly, "it is a person
who makes me miserable sometimes; and I wish she would keep
away&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I don't want her."</p>
<p id="id02237">"But who, Paulina, can it be? You puzzle me
much."</p>
<p id="id02238">"It is&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is my cousin Ginevra.
Every time she has leave to visit Mrs. Cholmondeley she calls here,
and whenever she finds me alone she begins to talk about her
admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear all she has to say about
love."</p>
<p id="id02239">"Oh, I have heard it," said I, quite coolly; "and
on the whole, perhaps it is as well you should have heard it too:
it is not to be regretted, it is all right. Yet, surely, Ginevra's
mind cannot influence yours. You can look over both her head and
her heart."</p>
<p id="id02240">"She does influence me very much. She has the art
of disturbing my happiness and unsettling my opinions. She hurts me
through the feelings and people dearest to me."</p>
<p id="id02241">"What does she say, Paulina? Give me some idea.
There may be counteraction of the damage done."</p>
<p id="id02242">"The people I have longest and most esteemed are
degraded by her. She does not spare Mrs.
Bretton&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she does not spare&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.
Graham."</p>
<p id="id02243">"No, I daresay: and how does she mix up these with
her sentiment and her&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.<i>love</i>? She does
mix them, I suppose?"</p>
<p id="id02244">"Lucy, she is insolent; and, I believe, false. You
know Dr. Bretton. We both know him. He may be careless and proud;
but when was he ever mean or slavish? Day after day she shows him
to me kneeling at her feet, pursuing her like her shadow.
She&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;repulsing him with insult, and he imploring
her with infatuation. Lucy, is it true? Is any of it true?"</p>
<p id="id02245">"It may be true that he once thought her handsome:
does she give him out as still her suitor?"</p>
<p id="id02246">"She says she might marry him any day: he only
waits her consent."</p>
<p id="id02247">"It is these tales which have caused that reserve
in your manner towards Graham which your father noticed."</p>
<p id="id02248">"They have certainly made me all doubtful about his
character. As<br />
Ginevra speaks, they do not carry with them the sound of unmixed
truth:<br />
I believe she exaggerates&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps
invents&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but I want to know how far."<br /></p>
<p id="id02249">"Suppose we bring Miss Fanshawe to some proof. Give
her an opportunity of displaying the power she boasts."</p>
<p id="id02250">"I could do that to-morrow. Papa has asked some
gentlemen to dinner, all savants. Graham, who, papa is beginning to
discover, is a savant, too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;skilled, they say, in
more than one branch of science&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is among the
number. Now I should be miserable to sit at table unsupported,
amidst such a party. I could not talk to Messieurs
A&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and
Z&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;, the Parisian
Academicians: all my new credit for manner would be put in peril.
You and Mrs. Bretton must come for my sake; Ginevra, at a word,
will join you."</p>
<p id="id02251">"Yes; then I will carry a message of invitation,
and she shall have the chance of justifying her character for
veracity."</p>
<h2 id="id02252" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h5 id="id02253">THE H&Atilde;&rdquo;TEL CR&Atilde;&permil;CY.</h5>
<p id="id02254" style="margin-top: 2em">The morrow turned out a
more lively and busy day than we&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or than I, at
least-had anticipated. It seems it was the birthday of one of the
young princes of Labassecour-the eldest, I think, the Duc de
Dindonneau, and a general holiday was given in his honour at the
schools, and especially at the principal
"Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e," or college. The youth of that
institution had also concocted, and were to present a loyal
address; for which purpose they were to be assembled in the public
building where the yearly examinations were conducted, and the
prizes distributed. After the ceremony of presentation, an oration,
or "discours," was to follow from one of the professors.</p>
<p id="id02255">Several of M. de Bassompierre's friends-the
savants-being more or less connected with the
Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e, they were expected to attend on
this occasion; together with the worshipful municipality of
Villette, M. le Chevalier Staas, the burgomaster, and the parents
and kinsfolk of the Athenians in general. M. de Bassompierre was
engaged by his friends to accompany them; his fair daughter would,
of course, be of the party, and she wrote a little note to Ginevra
and myself, bidding us come early that we might join her.</p>
<p id="id02256">As Miss Fanshawe and I were dressing in the
dormitory of the Rue<br />
Fossette, she (Miss F.) suddenly burst into a laugh.<br /></p>
<p id="id02257">"What now?" I asked; for she had suspended the
operation of arranging her attire, and was gazing at me.</p>
<p id="id02258">"It seems so odd," she replied, with her usual
half-honest half-insolent unreserve, "that you and I should now be
so much on a level, visiting in the same sphere; having the same
connections."</p>
<p id="id02259">"Why, yes," said I; "I had not much respect for the
connections you chiefly frequented awhile ago: Mrs. Cholmondeley
and Co. would never have suited me at all."</p>
<p id="id02260">"Who <i>are</i> you, Miss Snowe?" she inquired, in
a tone of such undisguised and unsophisticated curiosity, as made
me laugh in my turn.</p>
<p id="id02261">"You used to call yourself a nursery governess;
when you first came here you really had the care of the children in
this house: I have seen you carry little Georgette in your arms,
like a bonne&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;few governesses would have
condescended so far&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and now Madame Beck treats
you with more courtesy than she treats the Parisienne, St. Pierre;
and that proud chit, my cousin, makes you her bosom friend!"</p>
<p id="id02262">"Wonderful!" I agreed, much amused at her
mystification. "Who am I indeed? Perhaps a personage in disguise.
Pity I don't look the character."</p>
<p id="id02263">"I wonder you are not more flattered by all this,"
she went on; "you take it with strange composure. If you really are
the nobody I once thought you, you must be a cool hand."</p>
<p id="id02264">"The nobody you once thought me!" I repeated, and
my face grew a little hot; but I would not be angry: of what
importance was a school-girl's crude use of the terms nobody and
somebody? I confined myself, therefore, to the remark that I had
merely met with civility; and asked "what she saw in civility to
throw the recipient into a fever of confusion?"</p>
<p id="id02265">"One can't help wondering at some things," she
persisted.</p>
<p id="id02266">"Wondering at marvels of your own manufacture. Are
you ready at last?"</p>
<p id="id02267">"Yes; let me take your arm."</p>
<p id="id02268">"I would rather not: we will walk side by
side."</p>
<p id="id02269">When she took my arm, she always leaned upon me her
whole weight; and, as I was not a gentleman, or her lover, I did
not like it.</p>
<p id="id02270">"There, again!" she cried. "I thought, by offering
to take your arm, to intimate approbation of your dress and general
appearance: I meant it as a compliment."</p>
<p id="id02271">"You did? You meant, in short, to express that you
are not ashamed to be seen in the street with me? That if Mrs.
Cholmondeley should be fondling her lapdog at some window, or
Colonel de Hamal picking his teeth in a balcony, and should catch a
glimpse of us, you would not quite blush for your companion?"</p>
<p id="id02272">"Yes," said she, with that directness which was her
best point&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which gave an honest plainness to her
very fibs when she told them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which was, in
short, the salt, the sole preservative ingredient of a character
otherwise not formed to keep.</p>
<p id="id02273">I delegated the trouble of commenting on this "yes"
to my countenance; or rather, my under-lip voluntarily anticipated
my tongue of course, reverence and solemnity were not the feelings
expressed in the look I gave her.</p>
<p id="id02274">"Scornful, sneering creature!" she went on, as we
crossed a great square, and entered the quiet, pleasant park, our
nearest way to the Rue Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy. "Nobody in this world
was ever such a Turk to me as you are!"</p>
<p id="id02275">"You bring it on yourself: let me alone: have the
sense to be quiet: I will let you alone."</p>
<p id="id02276">"As if one <i>could</i> let you alone, when you are
so peculiar and so mysterious!"</p>
<p id="id02277">"The mystery and peculiarity being entirely the
conception of your own
brain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;maggots&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;neither more
nor less, be so good as to keep them out of my sight."</p>
<p id="id02278">"But <i>are</i> you anybody?" persevered she,
pushing her hand, in spite of me, under my arm; and that arm
pressed itself with inhospitable closeness against my side, by way
of keeping out the intruder.</p>
<p id="id02279">"Yes," I said, "I am a rising character: once an
old lady's companion, then a nursery-governess, now a
school-teacher."</p>
<p id="id02280">"Do&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>do</i> tell me who you
are? I'll not repeat it," she urged, adhering with ludicrous
tenacity to the wise notion of an incognito she had got hold of;
and she squeezed the arm of which she had now obtained full
possession, and coaxed and conjured till I was obliged to pause in
the park to laugh. Throughout our walk she rang the most fanciful
changes on this theme; proving, by her obstinate credulity, or
incredulity, her incapacity to conceive how any person not
bolstered up by birth or wealth, not supported by some
consciousness of name or connection, could maintain an attitude of
reasonable integrity. As for me, it quite sufficed to my mental
tranquillity that I was known where it imported that known I should
be; the rest sat on me easily: pedigree, social position, and
recondite intellectual acquisition, occupied about the same space
and place in my interests and thoughts; they were my third-class
lodgers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to whom could be assigned only the small
sitting-room and the little back bedroom: even if the dining and
drawing-rooms stood empty, I never confessed it to them, as
thinking minor accommodations better suited to their circumstances.
The world, I soon learned, held a different estimate: and I make no
doubt, the world is very right in its view, yet believe also that I
am not quite wrong in mine.</p>
<p id="id02281">There are people whom a lowered position degrades
morally, to whom loss of connection costs loss of self-respect: are
not these justified in placing the highest value on that station
and association which is their safeguard from debasement? If a man
feels that he would become contemptible in his own eyes were it
generally known that his ancestry were simple and not gentle, poor
and not rich, workers and not capitalists, would it be right
severely to blame him for keeping these fatal facts out of
sight&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for starting, trembling, quailing at the
chance which threatens exposure? The longer we live, the more out
experience widens; the less prone are we to judge our neighbour's
conduct, to question the world's wisdom: wherever an accumulation
of small defences is found, whether surrounding the prude's virtue
or the man of the world's respectability, there, be sure, it is
needed.</p>
<p id="id02282">We reached the H&Atilde;&acute;tel
Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy; Paulina was ready; Mrs. Bretton was with her;
and, under her escort and that of M. de Bassompierre, we were soon
conducted to the place of assembly, and seated in good seats, at a
convenient distance from the Tribune. The youth of the
Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e were marshalled before us, the
municipality and their bourgmestre were in places of honour, the
young princes, with their tutors, occupied a conspicuous position,
and the body of the building was crowded with the aristocracy and
first burghers of the town.</p>
<p id="id02283">Concerning the identity of the professor by whom
the "discours" was to be delivered, I had as yet entertained
neither care nor question. Some vague expectation I had that a
savant would stand up and deliver a formal speech, half dogmatism
to the Athenians, half flattery to the princes.</p>
<p id="id02284">The Tribune was yet empty when we entered, but in
ten minutes after it was filled; suddenly, in a second of time, a
head, chest, and arms grew above the crimson desk. This head I
knew: its colour, shape, port, expression, were familiar both to me
and Miss Fanshawe; the blackness and closeness of cranium, the
amplitude and paleness of brow, the blueness and fire of glance,
were details so domesticated in the memory, and so knit with many a
whimsical association, as almost by this their sudden apparition,
to tickle fancy to a laugh. Indeed, I confess, for my part, I did
laugh till I was warm; but then I bent my head, and made my
handkerchief and a lowered veil the sole confidants of my
mirth.</p>
<p id="id02285">I think I was glad to see M. Paul; I think it was
rather pleasant than otherwise, to behold him set up there, fierce
and frank, dark and candid, testy and fearless, as when regnant on
his estrade in class. His presence was such a surprise: I had not
once thought of expecting him, though I knew he filled the chair of
Belles Lettres in the college. With <i>him</i> in that Tribune, I
felt sure that neither formalism nor flattery would be our doom;
but for what was vouchsafed us, for what was poured suddenly,
rapidly, continuously, on our heads&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I own I was
not prepared.</p>
<p id="id02286">He spoke to the princes, the nobles, the
magistrates, and the burghers, with just the same ease, with almost
the same pointed, choleric earnestness, with which he was wont to
harangue the three divisions of the Rue Fossette. The collegians he
addressed, not as schoolboys, but as future citizens and embryo
patriots. The times which have since come on Europe had not been
foretold yet, and M. Emanuel's spirit seemed new to me. Who would
have thought the flat and fat soil of Labassecour could yield
political convictions and national feelings, such as were now
strongly expressed? Of the bearing of his opinions I need here give
no special indication; yet it may be permitted me to say that I
believed the little man not more earnest than right in what he
said: with all his fire he was severe and sensible; he trampled
Utopian theories under his heel; he rejected wild dreams with
scorn;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but when he looked in the face of
tyranny&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oh, then there opened a light in his eye
worth seeing; and when he spoke of injustice, his voice gave no
uncertain sound, but reminded me rather of the band-trumpet,
ringing at twilight from the park.</p>
<p id="id02287">I do not think his audience were generally
susceptible of sharing his flame in its purity; but some of the
college youth caught fire as he eloquently told them what should be
their path and endeavour in their country's and in Europe's future.
They gave him a long, loud, ringing cheer, as he concluded: with
all his fierceness, he was their favourite professor.</p>
<p id="id02288">As our party left the Hall, he stood at the
entrance; he saw and knew me, and lifted his hat; he offered his
hand in passing, and uttered the words "Qu'en dites
vous?"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;question eminently characteristic, and
reminding me, even in this his moment of triumph, of that
inquisitive restlessness, that absence of what I considered
desirable self-control, which were amongst his faults. He should
not have cared just then to ask what I thought, or what anybody
thought, but he <i>did</i> care, and he was too natural to conceal,
too impulsive to repress his wish. Well! if I blamed his
over-eagerness, I liked his <i>naivet&Atilde;&copy;</i>. I would
have praised him: I had plenty of praise in my heart; but, alas! no
words on my lips. Who <i>has</i> words at the right moment? I
stammered some lame expressions; but was truly glad when other
people, coming up with profuse congratulations, covered my
deficiency by their redundancy.</p>
<p id="id02289">A gentleman introduced him to M. de Bassompierre;
and the Count, who had likewise been highly gratified, asked him to
join his friends (for the most part M. Emanuel's likewise), and to
dine with them at the H&Atilde;&acute;tel Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy. He
declined dinner, for he was a man always somewhat shy at meeting
the advances of the wealthy: there was a strength of sturdy
independence in the stringing of his sinews&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not
obtrusive, but pleasant enough to discover as one advanced in
knowledge of his character; he promised, however, to step in with
his friend, M. A&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;, a French
Academician, in the course of the evening.</p>
<p id="id02290">At dinner that day, Ginevra and Paulina each
looked, in her own way, very beautiful; the former, perhaps,
boasted the advantage in material charms, but the latter shone
pre-eminent for attractions more subtle and spiritual: for light
and eloquence of eye, for grace of mien, for winning variety of
expression. Ginevra's dress of deep crimson relieved well her light
curls, and harmonized with her rose-like bloom. Paulina's
attire&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in fashion close, though faultlessly
neat, but in texture clear and white&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;made the
eye grateful for the delicate life of her complexion, for the soft
animation of her countenance, for the tender depth of her eyes, for
the brown shadow and bounteous flow of her
hair&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;darker than that of her Saxon cousin, as
were also her eyebrows, her eyelashes, her full irids, and large
mobile pupils. Nature having traced all these details slightly, and
with a careless hand, in Miss Fanshawe's case; and in Miss de
Bassompierre's, wrought them to a high and delicate finish.</p>
<p id="id02291">Paulina was awed by the savants, but not quite to
mutism: she conversed modestly, diffidently; not without effort,
but with so true a sweetness, so fine and penetrating a sense, that
her father more than once suspended his own discourse to listen,
and fixed on her an eye of proud delight. It was a polite
Frenchman, M. Z&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;, a very
learned, but quite a courtly man, who had drawn her into discourse.
I was charmed with her French; it was
faultless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the structure correct, the idioms
true, the accent pure; Ginevra, who had lived half her life on the
Continent, could do nothing like it not that words ever failed Miss
Fanshawe, but real accuracy and purity she neither possessed, nor
in any number of years would acquire. Here, too, M. de Bassompierre
was gratified; for, on the point of language, he was critical.</p>
<p id="id02292">Another listener and observer there was; one who,
detained by some exigency of his profession, had come in late to
dinner. Both ladies were quietly scanned by Dr. Bretton, at the
moment of taking his seat at the table; and that guarded survey was
more than once renewed. His arrival roused Miss Fanshawe, who had
hitherto appeared listless: she now became smiling and complacent,
talked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though what she said was rarely to the
purpose&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or rather, was of a purpose somewhat
mortifyingly below the standard of the occasion. Her light,
disconnected prattle might have gratified Graham once; perhaps it
pleased him still: perhaps it was only fancy which suggested the
thought that, while his eye was filled and his ear fed, his taste,
his keen zest, his lively intelligence, were not equally consulted
and regaled. It is certain that, restless and exacting as seemed
the demand on his attention, he yielded courteously all that was
required: his manner showed neither pique nor coolness: Ginevra was
his neighbour, and to her, during dinner, he almost exclusively
confined his notice. She appeared satisfied, and passed to the
drawing-room in very good spirits.</p>
<p id="id02293">Yet, no sooner had we reached that place of refuge,
than she again became flat and listless: throwing herself on a
couch, she denounced both the "discours" and the dinner as stupid
affairs, and inquired of her cousin how she could hear such a set
of prosaic "gros-bonnets" as her father gathered about him. The
moment the gentlemen were heard to move, her railings ceased: she
started up, flew to the piano, and dashed at it with spirit. Dr.
Bretton entering, one of the first, took up his station beside her.
I thought he would not long maintain that post: there was a
position near the hearth to which I expected to see him attracted:
this position he only scanned with his eye; while <i>he</i> looked,
others drew in. The grace and mind of Paulina charmed these
thoughtful Frenchmen: the fineness of her beauty, the soft courtesy
of her manner, her immature, but real and inbred tact, pleased
their national taste; they clustered about her, not indeed to talk
science; which would have rendered her dumb, but to touch on many
subjects in letters, in arts, in actual life, on which it soon
appeared that she had both read and reflected. I listened. I am
sure that though Graham stood aloof, he listened too: his hearing
as well as his vision was very fine, quick, discriminating. I knew
he gathered the conversation; I felt that the mode in which it was
sustained suited him exquisitely&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pleased him
almost to pain.</p>
<p id="id02294">In Paulina there was more force, both of feeling
and character; than most people thought&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;than
Graham himself imagined&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;than she would ever show
to those who did not wish to see it. To speak truth, reader, there
is no excellent beauty, no accomplished grace, no reliable
refinement, without strength as excellent, as complete, as
trustworthy. As well might you look for good fruit and blossom on a
rootless and sapless tree, as for charms that will endure in a
feeble and relaxed nature. For a little while, the blooming
semblance of beauty may flourish round weakness; but it cannot bear
a blast: it soon fades, even in serenest sunshine. Graham would
have started had any suggestive spirit whispered of the sinew and
the stamina sustaining that delicate nature; but I who had known
her as a child, knew or guessed by what a good and strong root her
graces held to the firm soil of reality.</p>
<p id="id02295">While Dr. Bretton listened, and waited an opening
in the magic circle, his glance restlessly sweeping the room at
intervals, lighted by chance on me, where I sat in a quiet nook not
far from my godmother and M. de Bassompierre, who, as usual, were
engaged in what Mr. Home called "a two-handed crack:" what the
Count would have interpreted as a
t&Atilde;&ordf;te-&Atilde;&nbsp;-t&Atilde;&ordf;te. Graham smiled
recognition, crossed the room, asked me how I was, told me I looked
pale. I also had my own smile at my own thought: it was now about
three months since Dr. John had spoken to me-a lapse of which he
was not even conscious. He sat down, and became silent. His wish
was rather to look than converse. Ginevra and Paulina were now
opposite to him: he could gaze his fill: he surveyed both
forms&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;studied both faces.</p>
<p id="id02296">Several new guests, ladies as well as gentlemen,
had entered the room since dinner, dropping in for the evening
conversation; and amongst the gentlemen, I may incidentally
observe, I had already noticed by glimpses, a severe, dark,
professorial outline, hovering aloof in an inner saloon, seen only
in vista. M. Emanuel knew many of the gentlemen present, but I
think was a stranger to most of the ladies, excepting myself; in
looking towards the hearth, he could not but see me, and naturally
made a movement to approach; seeing, however, Dr. Bretton also, he
changed his mind and held back. If that had been all, there would
have been no cause for quarrel; but not satisfied with holding
back, he puckered up his eyebrows, protruded his lip, and looked so
ugly that I averted my eyes from the displeasing spectacle. M.
Joseph Emanuel had arrived, as well as his austere brother, and at
this very moment was relieving Ginevra at the piano. What a
master-touch succeeded her school-girl jingle! In what grand,
grateful tones the instrument acknowledged the hand of the true
artist!</p>
<p id="id02297">"Lucy," began Dr. Bretton, breaking silence and
smiling, as Ginevra glided before him, casting a glance as she
passed by, "Miss Fanshawe is certainly a fine girl."</p>
<p id="id02298">Of course I assented.</p>
<p id="id02299">"Is there," he pursued, "another in the room as
lovely?"</p>
<p id="id02300">"I think there is not another as handsome."</p>
<p id="id02301">"I agree with you, Lucy: you and I do often agree
in opinion, in taste,<br />
I think; or at least in judgment."<br /></p>
<p id="id02302">"Do we?" I said, somewhat doubtfully.</p>
<p id="id02303">"I believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of
a girl&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my mother's god-son instead of her
god-daughter, we should have been good friends: our opinions would
have melted into each other."</p>
<p id="id02304">He had assumed a bantering air: a light,
half-caressing, half-ironic, shone aslant in his eye. Ah, Graham! I
have given more than one solitary moment to thoughts and
calculations of your estimate of Lucy Snowe: was it always kind or
just? Had Lucy been intrinsically the same but possessing the
additional advantages of wealth and station, would your manner to
her, your value for her, have been quite what they actually were?
And yet by these questions I would not seriously infer blame. No;
you might sadden and trouble me sometimes; but then mine was a
soon-depressed, an easily-deranged
temperament&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it fell if a cloud crossed the sun.
Perhaps before the eye of severe equity I should stand more at
fault than you.</p>
<p id="id02305">Trying, then, to keep down the unreasonable pain
which thrilled my heart, on thus being made to feel that while
Graham could devote to others the most grave and earnest, the
manliest interest, he had no more than light raillery for Lucy, the
friend of lang syne, I inquired calmly,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"On what
points are we so closely in accordance?"</p>
<p id="id02306">"We each have an observant faculty. You, perhaps,
don't give me credit for the possession; yet I have it."</p>
<p id="id02307">"But you were speaking of tastes: we may see the
same objects, yet estimate them differently?"</p>
<p id="id02308">"Let us bring it to the test. Of course, you cannot
but render homage to the merits of Miss Fanshawe: now, what do you
think of others in the room?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my mother, for
instance; or the lions yonder, Messieurs
A&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and
Z&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;; or, let us say, that
pale little lady, Miss de Bassompierre?"</p>
<p id="id02309">"You know what I think of your mother. I have not
thought of Messieurs<br />
A&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and
Z&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;."<br /></p>
<p id="id02310">"And the other?"</p>
<p id="id02311">"I think she is, as you say, a pale little
lady&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pale, certainly, just now, when she is
fatigued with over-excitement."</p>
<p id="id02312">"You don't remember her as a child?"</p>
<p id="id02313">"I wonder, sometimes, whether you do."</p>
<p id="id02314">"I had forgotten her; but it is noticeable, that
circumstances, persons, even words and looks, that had slipped your
memory, may, under certain conditions, certain aspects of your own
or another's mind, revive."</p>
<p id="id02315">"That is possible enough."</p>
<p id="id02316">"Yet," he continued, "the revival is
imperfect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;needs confirmation, partakes so much
of the dim character of a dream, or of the airy one of a fancy,
that the testimony of a witness becomes necessary for
corroboration. Were you not a guest at Bretton ten years ago, when
Mr. Home brought his little girl, whom we then called 'little
Polly,' to stay with mamma?"</p>
<p id="id02317">"I was there the night she came, and also the
morning she went away."</p>
<p id="id02318">"Rather a peculiar child, was she not? I wonder how
I treated her. Was I fond of children in those days? Was there
anything gracious or kindly about me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;great,
reckless, schoolboy as I was? But you don't recollect me, of
course?"</p>
<p id="id02319">"You have seen your own picture at La Terrasse. It
is like you personally. In manner, you were almost the same
yesterday as to-day."</p>
<p id="id02320">"But, Lucy, how is that? Such an oracle really
whets my curiosity. What am I to-day? What was I the yesterday of
ten years back?"</p>
<p id="id02321">"Gracious to whatever pleased
you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;unkindly or cruel to nothing."</p>
<p id="id02322">"There you are wrong; I think I was almost a brute
to <i>you</i>, for instance."</p>
<p id="id02323">"A brute! No, Graham: I should never have patiently
endured brutality."</p>
<p id="id02324">"<i>This</i>, however, I <i>do</i> remember: quiet
Lucy Snowe tasted nothing of my grace."</p>
<p id="id02325">"As little of your cruelty."</p>
<p id="id02326">"Why, had I been Nero himself, I could not have
tormented a being inoffensive as a shadow."</p>
<p id="id02327">I smiled; but I also hushed a groan.
Oh!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I just wished he would let me
alone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;cease allusion to me. These
epithets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these attributes I put from me. His
"quiet Lucy Snowe," his "inoffensive shadow," I gave him back; not
with scorn, but with extreme weariness: theirs was the coldness and
the pressure of lead; let him whelm me with no such weight.
Happily, he was soon on another theme.</p>
<p id="id02328">"On what terms were 'little Polly' and I? Unless my
recollections deceive me, we were not foes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02329">"You speak very vaguely. Do you think little
Polly's memory, not more definite?"</p>
<p id="id02330">"Oh! we don't talk of 'little Polly' <i>now</i>.
Pray say, Miss de Bassompierre; and, of course, such a stately
personage remembers nothing of Bretton. Look at her large eyes,
Lucy; can they read a word in the page of memory? Are they the same
which I used to direct to a horn-book? She does not know that I
partly taught her to read."</p>
<p id="id02331">"In the Bible on Sunday nights?"</p>
<p id="id02332">"She has a calm, delicate, rather fine profile now:
once what a little restless, anxious countenance was hers! What a
thing is a child's preference&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what a bubble!
Would you believe it? that lady was fond of me!"</p>
<p id="id02333">"I think she was in some measure fond of you," said
I, moderately.</p>
<p id="id02334">"You don't remember then? <i>I</i> had forgotten;
but I remember <i>now</i>. She liked me the best of whatever there
was at Bretton."</p>
<p id="id02335">"You thought so."</p>
<p id="id02336">"I quite well recall it. I wish I could tell her
all I recall; or rather, I wish some one, you for instance, would
go behind and whisper it all in her ear, and I could have the
delight&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;here, as I sit&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of
watching her look under the intelligence. Could you manage that,
think you, Lucy, and make me ever grateful?"</p>
<p id="id02337">"Could I manage to make you ever grateful?" said I.
"No, <i>I could not</i>." And I felt my fingers work and my hands
interlock: I felt, too, an inward courage, warm and resistant. In
this matter I was not disposed to gratify Dr. John: not at all.
With now welcome force, I realized his entire misapprehension of my
character and nature. He wanted always to give me a role not mine.
Nature and I opposed him. He did not at all guess what I felt: he
did not read my eyes, or face, or gestures; though, I doubt not,
all spoke. Leaning towards me coaxingly, he said, softly,
"<i>Do</i> content me, Lucy."</p>
<p id="id02338">And I would have contented, or, at least, I would
clearly have enlightened him, and taught him well never again to
expect of me the part of officious soubrette in a love drama; when,
following his, soft, eager, murmur, meeting almost his pleading,
mellow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"<i>Do</i> content me, Lucy!" a sharp
hiss pierced my ear on the other side.</p>
<p id="id02339">"Petite chatte, doucerette, coquette!" sibillated
the sudden boa-constrictor; "vous avez l'air bien triste, soumis,
r&Atilde;&ordf;veur, mais vous ne l'&Atilde;&ordf;tes pas: c'est
moi qui vous le dis: Sauvage! la flamme &Atilde;&nbsp;
l'&Atilde;&cent;me, l'&Atilde;&copy;clair aux yeux!"</p>
<p id="id02340">"Oui; j'ai la flamme &Atilde;&nbsp;
l'&Atilde;&cent;me, et je dois l'avoir!" retorted I, turning in
just wrath: but Professor Emanuel had hissed his insult and was
gone.</p>
<p id="id02341">The worst of the matter was, that Dr. Bretton,
whose ears, as I have said, were quick and fine, caught every word
of this apostrophe; he put his handkerchief to his face, and
laughed till he shook.</p>
<p id="id02342">"Well done, Lucy," cried he; "capital! petite
chatte, petite coquette! Oh, I must tell my mother! Is it true,
Lucy, or half-true? I believe it is: you redden to the colour of
Miss Fanshawe's gown. And really, by my word, now I examine him,
that is the same little man who was so savage with you at the
concert: the very same, and in his soul he is frantic at this
moment because he sees me laughing. Oh! I must tease him."</p>
<p id="id02343">And Graham, yielding to his bent for mischief,
laughed, jested, and whispered on till I could bear no more, and my
eyes filled.</p>
<p id="id02344">Suddenly he was sobered: a vacant space appeared
near Miss de Bassompierre; the circle surrounding her seemed about
to dissolve. This movement was instantly caught by Graham's
eye&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ever-vigilant, even while laughing; he rose,
took his courage in both hands, crossed the room, and made the
advantage his own. Dr. John, throughout his whole life, was a man
of luck&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a man of success. And why? Because he
had the eye to see his opportunity, the heart to prompt to
well-timed action, the nerve to consummate a perfect work. And no
tyrant-passion dragged him back; no enthusiasms, no foibles
encumbered his way. How well he looked at this very moment! When
Paulina looked up as he reached her side, her glance mingled at
once with an encountering glance, animated, yet modest; his colour,
as he spoke to her, became half a blush, half a glow. He stood in
her presence brave and bashful: subdued and unobtrusive, yet
decided in his purpose and devoted in his ardour. I gathered all
this by one view. I did not prolong my
observation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;time failed me, had inclination
served: the night wore late; Ginevra and I ought already to have
been in the Rue Fossette. I rose, and bade good-night to my
godmother and M. de Bassompierre.</p>
<p id="id02345">I know not whether Professor Emanuel had noticed my
reluctant acceptance of Dr. Bretton's badinage, or whether he
perceived that I was pained, and that, on the whole, the evening
had not been one flow of exultant enjoyment for the volatile,
pleasure-loving Mademoiselle Lucie; but, as I was leaving the room,
he stepped up and inquired whether I had any one to attend me to
the Rue Fossette. The professor <i>now</i> spoke politely, and even
deferentially, and he looked apologetic and repentant; but I could
not recognise his civility at a word, nor meet his contrition with
crude, premature oblivion. Never hitherto had I felt seriously
disposed to resent his brusqueries, or freeze before his
fierceness; what he had said to-night, however, I considered
unwarranted: my extreme disapprobation of the proceeding must be
marked, however slightly. I merely said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I am
provided with attendance."</p>
<p id="id02346">Which was true, as Ginevra and I were to be sent
home in the carriage; and I passed him with the sliding obeisance
with which he was wont to be saluted in classe by pupils crossing
his estrade.</p>
<p id="id02347">Having sought my shawl, I returned to the
vestibule. M. Emanuel stood there as if waiting. He observed that
the night was fine.</p>
<p id="id02348">"Is it?" I said, with a tone and manner whose
consummate chariness and frostiness I could not but applaud. It was
so seldom I could properly act out my own resolution to be reserved
and cool where I had been grieved or hurt, that I felt almost proud
of this one successful effort. That "Is it?" sounded just like the
manner of other people. I had heard hundreds of such little minced,
docked, dry phrases, from the pursed-up coral lips of a score of
self-possessed, self-sufficing misses and mesdemoiselles. That M.
Paul would not stand any prolonged experience of this sort of
dialogue I knew; but he certainly merited a sample of the curt and
arid. I believe he thought so himself, for he took the dose
quietly. He looked at my shawl and objected to its lightness. I
decidedly told him it was as heavy as I wished. Receding aloof, and
standing apart, I leaned on the banister of the stairs, folded my
shawl about me, and fixed my eyes on a dreary religious painting
darkening the wall.</p>
<p id="id02349">Ginevra was long in coming: tedious seemed her
loitering. M. Paul was still there; my ear expected from his lips
an angry tone. He came nearer. "Now for another hiss!" thought I:
had not the action been too uncivil I could have, stopped my ears
with my fingers in terror of the thrill. Nothing happens as we
expect: listen for a coo or a murmur; it is then you will hear a
cry of prey or pain. Await a piercing shriek, an angry threat, and
welcome an amicable greeting, a low kind whisper. M. Paul spoke
gently:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Friends," said he, "do not quarrel for
a word. Tell me, was it I or ce grand fat d'Anglais" (so he
profanely denominated Dr. Bretton), "who made your eyes so humid,
and your cheeks so hot as they are even now?"</p>
<p id="id02350">"I am not conscious of you, monsieur, or of any
other having excited such emotion as you indicate," was my answer;
and in giving it, I again surpassed my usual self, and achieved a
neat, frosty falsehood.</p>
<p id="id02351">"But what did I say?" he pursued; "tell me: I was
angry: I have forgotten my words; what were they?"</p>
<p id="id02352">"Such as it is best to forget!" said I, still quite
calm and chill.</p>
<p id="id02353">"Then it was <i>my</i> words which wounded you?
Consider them unsaid: permit my retractation; accord my
pardon."</p>
<p id="id02354">"I am not angry, Monsieur."</p>
<p id="id02355">"Then you are worse than
angry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;grieved. Forgive me, Miss Lucy."</p>
<p id="id02356">"M. Emanuel, I <i>do</i> forgive you."</p>
<p id="id02357">"Let me hear you say, in the voice natural to you,
and not in that alien tone, 'Mon ami, je vous pardonne.'"</p>
<p id="id02358">He made me smile. Who could help smiling at his
wistfulness, his simplicity, his earnestness?</p>
<p id="id02359">"Bon!" he cried. "Voil&Atilde;&nbsp; que le jour va
poindre! Dites donc, mon ami."</p>
<p id="id02360">"Monsieur Paul, je vous pardonne."</p>
<p id="id02361">"I will have no monsieur: speak the other word, or
I shall not believe you sincere: another
effort&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>mon ami</i>, or else in
English,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my friend!"</p>
<p id="id02362">Now, "my friend" had rather another sound and
significancy than "<i>mon ami</i>;" it did not breathe the same
sense of domestic and intimate affection; "<i>mon ami</i>" I could
<i>not</i> say to M. Paul; "my friend," I could, and did say
without difficulty. This distinction existed not for him, however,
and he was quite satisfied with the English phrase. He smiled. You
should have seen him smile, reader; and you should have marked the
difference between his countenance now, and that he wore half an
hour ago. I cannot affirm that I had ever witnessed the smile of
pleasure, or content, or kindness round M. Paul's lips, or in his
eyes before. The ironic, the sarcastic, the disdainful, the
passionately exultant, I had hundreds of times seen him express by
what he called a smile, but any illuminated sign of milder or
warmer feelings struck me as wholly new in his visage. It changed
it as from a mask to a face: the deep lines left his features; the
very complexion seemed clearer and fresher; that swart, sallow,
southern darkness which spoke his Spanish blood, became displaced
by a lighter hue. I know not that I have ever seen in any other
human face an equal metamorphosis from a similar cause. He now took
me to the carriage: at the same moment M. de Bassompierre came out
with his niece.</p>
<p id="id02363">In a pretty humour was Mistress Fanshawe; she had
found the evening a grand failure: completely upset as to temper,
she gave way to the most uncontrolled moroseness as soon as we were
seated, and the carriage-door closed. Her invectives against Dr.
Bretton had something venomous in them. Having found herself
impotent either to charm or sting him, hatred was her only
resource; and this hatred she expressed in terms so unmeasured and
proportion so monstrous, that, after listening for a while with
assumed stoicism, my outraged sense of justice at last and suddenly
caught fire. An explosion ensued: for I could be passionate, too;
especially with my present fair but faulty associate, who never
failed to stir the worst dregs of me. It was well that the
carriage-wheels made a tremendous rattle over the flinty Choseville
pavement, for I can assure the reader there was neither dead
silence nor calm discussion within the vehicle. Half in earnest,
half in seeming, I made it my business to storm down Ginevra. She
had set out rampant from the Rue Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy; it was
necessary to tame her before we reached the Rue Fossette: to this
end it was indispensable to show up her sterling value and high
deserts; and this must be done in language of which the fidelity
and homeliness might challenge comparison with the compliments of a
John Knox to a Mary Stuart. This was the right discipline for
Ginevra; it suited her. I am quite sure she went to bed that night
all the better and more settled in mind and mood, and slept all the
more sweetly for having undergone a sound moral drubbing.</p>
<h2 id="id02364" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h5 id="id02365">THE WATCHGUARD.</h5>
<p id="id02366" style="margin-top: 2em">M. Paul Emanuel owned an
acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of interruption, from
whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: to pass through the
classe under such circumstances was considered by the teachers and
pupils of the school, individually and collectively, to be as much
as a woman's or girl's life was worth.</p>
<p id="id02367">Madame Beck herself, if forced to the enterprise,
would "skurry" through, retrenching her skirts, and carefully
coasting the formidable estrade, like a ship dreading breakers. As
to Rosine, the portress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on whom, every
half-hour, devolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out of the
very heart of one or other of the divisions to take their
music-lessons in the oratory, the great or little saloon, the
salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger, or some other
piano-station&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she would, upon her second or
third attempt, frequently become almost tongue-tied from excess of
consternation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sentiment inspired by the
unspeakable looks levelled at her through a pair of dart-dealing
spectacles.</p>
<p id="id02368">One morning I was sitting in the
carr&Atilde;&copy;, at work upon a piece of embroidery which one of
the pupils had commenced but delayed to finish, and while my
fingers wrought at the frame, my ears regaled themselves with
listening to the crescendos and cadences of a voice haranguing in
the neighbouring classe, in tones that waxed momentarily more
unquiet, more ominously varied. There was a good strong
partition-wall between me and the gathering storm, as well as a
facile means of flight through the glass-door to the court, in case
it swept this way; so I am afraid I derived more amusement than
alarm from these thickening symptoms. Poor Rosine was not safe:
four times that blessed morning had she made the passage of peril;
and now, for the fifth time, it became her dangerous duty to
snatch, as it were, a brand from the burning&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
pupil from under M. Paul's nose.</p>
<p id="id02369">"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!" cried she. "Que vais-je
devenir? Monsieur va me tuer, je suis s&Atilde;&raquo;re; car il
est d'une col&Atilde;&uml;re!"</p>
<p id="id02370">Nerved by the courage of desperation, she opened
the door.</p>
<p id="id02371">"Mademoiselle La Malle au piano!" was her cry.</p>
<p id="id02372">Ere she could make good her retreat, or quite close
the door, this voice uttered itself:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02373">"D&Atilde;&uml;s ce moment!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;la
classe est d&Atilde;&copy;fendue. La premi&Atilde;&uml;re qui
ouvrira cette porte, ou passera par cette division, sera
pendue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fut-ce Madame Beck
elle-m&Atilde;&ordf;me!"</p>
<p id="id02374">Ten minutes had not succeeded the promulgation of
this decree when Rosine's French pantoufles were again heard
shuffling along the corridor.</p>
<p id="id02375">"Mademoiselle," said she, "I would not for a
five-franc piece go into that classe again just now: Monsieur's
lunettes are really terrible; and here is a commissionaire come
with a message from the Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e. I have
told Madame Beck I dare not deliver it, and she says I am to charge
you with it."</p>
<p id="id02376">"Me? No, that is rather too bad! It is not in my
line of duty. Come, come, Rosine! bear your own burden. Be
brave&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;charge once more!"</p>
<p id="id02377">"I, Mademoiselle?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;impossible!
Five times I have crossed him this day. Madame must really hire a
gendarme for this service. Ouf! Je n'en puis plus!"</p>
<p id="id02378">"Bah! you are only a coward. What is the
message?"</p>
<p id="id02379">"Precisely of the kind with which Monsieur least
likes to be pestered: an urgent summons to go directly to the
Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e, as there is an official
visitor&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;inspector&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I know not
what&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;arrived, and Monsieur <i>must</i> meet him:
you know how he hates a <i>must</i>."</p>
<p id="id02380">Yes, I knew well enough. The restive little man
detested spur or curb: against whatever was urgent or obligatory,
he was sure to revolt. However, I accepted the
responsibility&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not, certainly, without fear, but
fear blent with other sentiments, curiosity, amongst them. I opened
the door, I entered, I closed it behind me as quickly and quietly
as a rather unsteady hand would permit; for to be slow or bustling,
to rattle a latch, or leave a door gaping wide, were aggravations
of crime often more disastrous in result than the main crime
itself. There I stood then, and there he sat; his humour was
visibly bad&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost at its worst; he had been
giving a lesson in arithmetic&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for he gave
lessons on any and every subject that struck his
fancy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and arithmetic being a dry subject,
invariably disagreed with him: not a pupil but trembled when he
spoke of figures. He sat, bent above his desk: to look up at the
sound of an entrance, at the occurrence of a direct breach of his
will and law, was an effort he could not for the moment bring
himself to make. It was quite as well: I thus gained time to walk
up the long classe; and it suited my idiosyncracy far better to
encounter the near burst of anger like his, than to bear its menace
at a distance.</p>
<p id="id02381">At his estrade I paused, just in front; of course I
was not worthy of immediate attention: he proceeded with his
lesson. Disdain would not do: he must hear and he must answer my
message.</p>
<p id="id02382">Not being quite tall enough to lift my head over
his desk, elevated upon the estrade, and thus suffering eclipse in
my present position, I ventured to peep round, with the design, at
first, of merely getting a better view of his face, which had
struck me when I entered as bearing a close and picturesque
resemblance to that of a black and sallow tiger. Twice did I enjoy
this side-view with impunity, advancing and receding unseen; the
third time my eye had scarce dawned beyond the obscuration of the
desk, when it was caught and transfixed through its very
pupil&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;transfixed by the "lunettes." Rosine was
right; these utensils had in them a blank and immutable terror,
beyond the mobile wrath of the wearer's own unglazed eyes.</p>
<p id="id02383">I now found the advantage of proximity: these
short-sighted "lunettes" were useless for the inspection of a
criminal under Monsieur's nose; accordingly, he doffed them, and he
and I stood on more equal terms.</p>
<p id="id02384">I am glad I was not really much afraid of
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that, indeed, close in his presence, I felt
no terror at all; for upon his demanding cord and gibbet to execute
the sentence recently pronounced, I was able to furnish him with a
needleful of embroidering thread with such accommodating civility
as could not but allay some portion at least of his surplus
irritation. Of course I did not parade this courtesy before public
view: I merely handed the thread round the angle of the desk, and
attached it, ready noosed, to the barred back of the Professor's
chair.</p>
<p id="id02385">"Que me voulez-vous?" said he in a growl of which
the music was wholly confined to his chest and throat, for he kept
his teeth clenched; and seemed registering to himself an inward vow
that nothing earthly should wring from him a smile.</p>
<p id="id02386">My answer commenced uncompromisingly: "Monsieur," I
said, "je veux l'impossible, des choses inou&Atilde;&macr;es;" and
thinking it best not to mince matters, but to administer the
"douche" with decision, in a low but quick voice, I delivered the
Athenian message, floridly exaggerating its urgency.</p>
<p id="id02387">Of course, he would not hear a word of it. "He
would not go; he would not leave his present class, let all the
officials of Villette send for him. He would not put himself an
inch out of his way at the bidding of king, cabinet, and chambers
together."</p>
<p id="id02388">I knew, however, that he <i>must</i> go; that, talk
as he would, both his duty and interest commanded an immediate and
literal compliance with the summons: I stood, therefore, waiting in
silence, as if he had not yet spoken. He asked what more I
wanted.</p>
<p id="id02389">"Only Monsieur's answer to deliver to the
commissionaire."</p>
<p id="id02390">He waved an impatient negative.</p>
<p id="id02391">I ventured to stretch my hand to the bonnet-grec
which lay in grim repose on the window-sill. He followed this
daring movement with his eye, no doubt in mixed pity and amazement
at its presumption.</p>
<p id="id02392">"Ah!" he muttered, "if it came to
that&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if Miss Lucy meddled with his
bonnet-grec&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she might just put it on herself,
turn gar&Atilde;&sect;on for the occasion, and benevolently go to
the Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e in his stead."</p>
<p id="id02393">With great respect, I laid the bonnet on the desk,
where its tassel seemed to give me an awful nod.</p>
<p id="id02394">"I'll write a note of
apology&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that will do!" said he, still bent on
evasion.</p>
<p id="id02395">Knowing well it would <i>not</i> do, I gently
pushed the bonnet towards his hand. Thus impelled, it slid down the
polished slope of the varnished and unbaized desk, carried before
it the light steel-framed "lunettes," and, fearful to relate, they
fell to the estrade. A score of times ere now had I seen them fall
and receive no damage&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>this</i> time, as Lucy
Snowe's hapless luck would have it, they so fell that each clear
pebble became a shivered and shapeless star.</p>
<p id="id02396">Now, indeed, dismay seized
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dismay and regret. I knew the value of these
"lunettes": M. Paul's sight was peculiar, not easily fitted, and
these glasses suited him. I had heard him call them his treasures:
as I picked them up, cracked and worthless, my hand trembled.
Frightened through all my nerves I was to see the mischief I had
done, but I think I was even more sorry than afraid. For some
seconds I dared not look the bereaved Professor in the face; he was
the first to speak.</p>
<p id="id02397">"L&Atilde;&nbsp;!" said he: "me voil&Atilde;&nbsp;
veuf de mes lunettes! I think Mademoiselle Lucy will now confess
that the cord and gallows are amply earned; she trembles in
anticipation of her doom. Ah, traitress! traitress! You are
resolved to have me quite blind and helpless in your hands!"</p>
<p id="id02398">I lifted my eyes: his face, instead of being irate,
lowering, and furrowed, was overflowing with the smile, coloured
with the bloom I had seen brightening it that evening at the Hotel
Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy. He was not angry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not even
grieved. For the real injury he showed himself full of clemency;
under the real provocation, patient as a saint. This event, which
seemed so untoward&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which I thought had ruined at
once my chance of successful persuasion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;proved
my best help. Difficult of management so long as I had done him no
harm, he became graciously pliant as soon as I stood in his
presence a conscious and contrite offender.</p>
<p id="id02399">Still gently railing at me as "une forte
femme&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;une Anglaise
terrible&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;une petite
casse-tout"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he declared that he dared not but
obey one who had given such an instance of her dangerous prowess;
it was absolutely like the "grand Empereur smashing the vase to
inspire dismay." So, at last, crowning himself with his
bonnet-grec, and taking his ruined "lunettes" from my hand with a
clasp of kind pardon and encouragement, he made his bow, and went
off to the Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e in first-rate humour
and spirits.</p>
<p id="id02400">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id02401">After all this amiability, the reader will be sorry
for my sake to hear that I was quarrelling with M. Paul again
before night; yet so it was, and I could not help it.</p>
<p id="id02402">It was his occasional custom&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
a very laudable, acceptable custom, too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to
arrive of an evening, always &Atilde;&nbsp; l'improviste,
unannounced, burst in on the silent hour of study, establish a
sudden despotism over us and our occupations, cause books to be put
away, work-bags to be brought out, and, drawing forth a single
thick volume, or a handful of pamphlets, substitute for the
besotted "lecture pieuse," drawled by a sleepy pupil, some tragedy
made grand by grand reading, ardent by fiery
action&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;some drama, whereof, for my part, I
rarely studied the intrinsic merit; for M. Emanuel made it a vessel
for an outpouring, and filled it with his native verve and passion
like a cup with a vital brewage. Or else he would flash through our
conventual darkness a reflex of a brighter world, show us a glimpse
of the current literature of the day, read us passages from some
enchanting tale, or the last witty feuilleton which had awakened
laughter in the saloons of Paris; taking care always to expunge,
with the severest hand, whether from tragedy, melodrama, tale, or
essay, whatever passage, phrase, or word, could be deemed unsuited
to an audience of "jeunes filles." I noticed more than once, that
where retrenchment without substitute would have left unmeaning
vacancy, or introduced weakness, he could, and did, improvise whole
paragraphs, no less vigorous than irreproachable; the
dialogue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the description&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he
engrafted was often far better than that he pruned away.</p>
<p id="id02403">Well, on the evening in question, we were sitting
silent as nuns in a "retreat," the pupils studying, the teachers
working. I remember my work; it was a slight matter of fancy, and
it rather interested me; it had a purpose; I was not doing it
merely to kill time; I meant it when finished as a gift; and the
occasion of presentation being near, haste was requisite, and my
fingers were busy.</p>
<p id="id02404">We heard the sharp bell-peal which we all knew;
then the rapid step familiar to each ear: the words
"Voil&Atilde;&nbsp; Monsieur!" had scarcely broken simultaneously
from every lip, when the two-leaved door split (as split it always
did for his admission&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such a slow word as "open"
is inefficient to describe his movements), and he stood in the
midst of us.</p>
<p id="id02405">There were two study tables, both long and flanked
with benches; over the centre of each hung a lamp; beneath this
lamp, on either side the table, sat a teacher; the girls were
arranged to the right hand and the left; the eldest and most
studious nearest the lamps or tropics; the idlers and little ones
towards the north and south poles. Monsieur's habit was politely to
hand a chair to some teacher, generally Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St.
Pierre, the senior mistress; then to take her vacated seat; and
thus avail himself of the full beam of Cancer or Capricorn, which,
owing to his near sight, he needed.</p>
<p id="id02406">As usual, Z&Atilde;&copy;lie rose with alacrity,
smiling to the whole extent of her mouth, and the full display of
her upper and under rows of teeth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that strange
smile which passes from ear to ear, and is marked only by a sharp
thin curve, which fails to spread over the countenance, and neither
dimples the cheek nor lights the eye. I suppose Monsieur did not
see her, or he had taken a whim that he would not notice her, for
he was as capricious as women are said to be; then his "lunettes"
(he had got another pair) served him as an excuse for all sorts of
little oversights and shortcomings. Whatever might be his reason,
he passed by Z&Atilde;&copy;lie, came to the other side of the
table, and before I could start up to clear the way, whispered, "Ne
bougez pas," and established himself between me and Miss Fanshawe,
who always would be my neighbour, and have her elbow in my side,
however often I declared to her, "Ginevra, I wish you were at
Jericho."</p>
<p id="id02407">It was easy to say, "Ne bougez pas;" but how could
I help it? I must make him room, and I must request the pupils to
recede that <i>I</i> might recede. It was very well for Ginevra to
be gummed to me, "keeping herself warm," as she said, on the winter
evenings, and harassing my very heart with her fidgetings and
pokings, obliging me, indeed, sometimes to put an artful pin in my
girdle by way of protection against her elbow; but I suppose M.
Emanuel was not to be subjected to the same kind of treatment, so I
swept away my working materials, to clear space for his book, and
withdrew myself to make room for his person; not, however, leaving
more than a yard of interval, just what any reasonable man would
have regarded as a convenient, respectful allowance of bench. But
M. Emanuel never <i>was</i> reasonable; flint and tinder that he
was! he struck and took fire directly.</p>
<p id="id02408">"Vous ne voulez pas de moi pour voisin," he
growled: "vous vous donnez des airs de caste; vous me traitez en
paria;" he scowled. "Soit! je vais arranger la chose!" And he set
to work.</p>
<p id="id02409">"Levez vous toutes, Mesdemoiselles!" cried he.</p>
<p id="id02410">The girls rose. He made them all file off to the
other table. He then placed me at one extremity of the long bench,
and having duly and carefully brought me my work-basket, silk,
scissors, all my implements, he fixed himself quite at the other
end.</p>
<p id="id02411">At this arrangement, highly absurd as it was, not a
soul in the room dared to laugh; luckless for the giggler would
have been the giggle. As for me, I took it with entire coolness.
There I sat, isolated and cut off from human intercourse; I sat and
minded my work, and was quiet, and not at all unhappy.</p>
<p id="id02412">"Est ce assez de distance?" he demanded.</p>
<p id="id02413">"Monsieur en est l'arbitre," said I.</p>
<p id="id02414">"Vous savez bien que non. C'est vous qui avez
cr&Atilde;&copy;e ce vide immense: moi je n'y ai pas mis la
main."</p>
<p id="id02415">And with this assertion he commenced the
reading.</p>
<p id="id02416">For his misfortune he had chosen a French
translation of what he called "un drame de Williams Shackspire; le
faux dieu," he further announced, "de ces sots pa&Atilde;&macr;ens,
les Anglais." How far otherwise he would have characterized him had
his temper not been upset, I scarcely need intimate.</p>
<p id="id02417">Of course, the translation being French, was very
inefficient; nor did I make any particular effort to conceal the
contempt which some of its forlorn lapses were calculated to
excite. Not that it behoved or beseemed me to say anything: but one
can occasionally <i>look</i> the opinion it is forbidden to embody
in words. Monsieur's lunettes being on the alert, he gleaned up
every stray look; I don't think he lost one: the consequence was,
his eyes soon discarded a screen, that their blaze might sparkle
free, and he waxed hotter at the north pole to which he had
voluntarily exiled himself, than, considering the general
temperature of the room, it would have been reasonable to become
under the vertical ray of Cancer itself.</p>
<p id="id02418">The reading over, it appeared problematic whether
he would depart with his anger unexpressed, or whether he would
give it vent. Suppression was not much in his habits; but still,
what had been done to him definite enough to afford matter for
overt reproof? I had not uttered a sound, and could not justly be
deemed amenable to reprimand or penalty for having permitted a
slightly freer action than usual to the muscles about my eyes and
mouth.</p>
<p id="id02419">The supper, consisting of bread, and milk diluted
with tepid water, was brought in. In respectful consideration of
the Professor's presence, the rolls and glasses were allowed to
stand instead of being immediately handed round.</p>
<p id="id02420">"Take your supper, ladies," said he, seeming to be
occupied in making marginal notes to his "Williams Shackspire."
They took it. I also accepted a roll and glass, but being now more
than ever interested in my work, I kept my seat of punishment, and
wrought while I munched my bread and sipped my beverage, the whole
with easy <i>sang-froid</i>; with a certain snugness of composure,
indeed, scarcely in my habits, and pleasantly novel to my feelings.
It seemed as if the presence of a nature so restless, chafing,
thorny as that of M. Paul absorbed all feverish and unsettling
influences like a magnet, and left me none but such as were placid
and harmonious.</p>
<p id="id02421">He rose. "Will he go away without saying another
word?" Yes; he turned to the door.</p>
<p id="id02422">No: he <i>re</i>-turned on his steps; but only,
perhaps, to take his pencil-case, which had been left on the
table.</p>
<p id="id02423">He took it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shut the pencil in
and out, broke its point against the wood, re-cut and pocketed it,
and . . . walked promptly up to me.</p>
<p id="id02424">The girls and teachers, gathered round the other
table, were talking pretty freely: they always talked at meals;
and, from the constant habit of speaking fast and loud at such
times, did not now subdue their voices much.</p>
<p id="id02425">M. Paul came and stood behind me. He asked at what
I was working; and I said I was making a watchguard.</p>
<p id="id02426">He asked, "For whom?" And I answered, "For a
gentleman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one of my friends."</p>
<p id="id02427">M. Paul stooped down and
proceeded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as novel-writers say, and, as was
literally true in his case&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to "hiss" into my ear
some poignant words.</p>
<p id="id02428">He said that, of all the women he knew, I was the
one who could make herself the most consummately unpleasant: I was
she with whom it was least possible to live on friendly terms. I
had a "caract&Atilde;&uml;re intraitable," and perverse to a
miracle. How I managed it, or what possessed me, he, for his part,
did not know; but with whatever pacific and amicable intentions a
person accosted me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;crac! I turned concord to
discord, good-will to enmity. He was sure, he&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;M.
Paul&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wished me well enough; he had never done me
any harm that he knew of; he might, at least, he supposed, claim a
right to be regarded as a neutral acquaintance, guiltless of
hostile sentiments: yet, how I behaved to him! With what pungent
vivacities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what an impetus of
mutiny&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what a "fougue" of injustice!</p>
<p id="id02429">Here I could not avoid opening my eyes somewhat
wide, and even slipping in a slight interjectional observation:
"Vivacities? Impetus? Fougue? I didn't
know&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."</p>
<p id="id02430">"Chut! &Atilde;&nbsp; l'instant! There! there I
went&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;vive comme la poudre!" He was
sorry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was very sorry: for my sake he grieved
over the hapless peculiarity. This "emportement," this
"chaleur"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;generous, perhaps, but
excessive&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;would yet, he feared, do me a
mischief. It was a pity: I was not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he believed,
in his soul&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wholly without good qualities: and
would I but hear reason, and be more sedate, more sober, less "en
l'air," less "coquette," less taken by show, less prone to set an
undue value on outside excellence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to make much
of the attentions of people remarkable chiefly for so many feet of
stature, "des couleurs de poup&Atilde;&copy;e," "un nez plus ou
moins bien fait," and an enormous amount of
fatuity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I might yet prove an useful, perhaps an
exemplary character. But, as it was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;And here,
the little man's voice was for a minute choked.</p>
<p id="id02431">I would have looked up at him, or held out my hand,
or said a soothing word; but I was afraid, if I stirred, I should
either laugh or cry; so odd, in all this, was the mixture of the
touching and the absurd.</p>
<p id="id02432">I thought he had nearly done: but no; he sat down
that he might go on at his ease.</p>
<p id="id02433">"While he, M. Paul, was on these painful topics, he
would dare my anger for the sake of my good, and would venture to
refer to a change he had noticed in my dress. He was free to
confess that when he first knew me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or, rather,
was in the habit of catching a passing glimpse of me from time to
time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I satisfied him on this point: the gravity,
the austere simplicity, obvious in this particular, were such as to
inspire the highest hopes for my best interests. What fatal
influence had impelled me lately to introduce flowers under the
brim of my bonnet, to wear 'des cols brod&Atilde;&copy;s,' and even
to appear on one occasion in a <i>scarlet
gown</i>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he might indeed conjecture, but, for
the present, would not openly declare."</p>
<p id="id02434">Again I interrupted, and this time not without an
accent at once indignant and horror-struck.</p>
<p id="id02435">"Scarlet, Monsieur Paul? It was not scarlet! It was
pink, and pale pink to: and further subdued by black lace."</p>
<p id="id02436">"Pink or scarlet, yellow or crimson, pea-green or
sky-blue, it was all one: these were all flaunting, giddy colours;
and as to the lace I talked of, <i>that</i> was but a 'colifichet
de plus.'" And he sighed over my degeneracy. "He could not, he was
sorry to say, be so particular on this theme as he could wish: not
possessing the exact names of these 'babioles,' he might run into
small verbal errors which would not fail to lay him open to my
sarcasm, and excite my unhappily sudden and passionate disposition.
He would merely say, in general terms&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and in
these general terms he knew he was correct&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
my costume had of late assumed 'des fa&Atilde;&sect;ons mondaines,'
which it wounded him to see."</p>
<p id="id02437">What "fa&Atilde;&sect;ons mondaines" he discovered
in my present winter merino and plain white collar, I own it
puzzled me to guess: and when I asked him, he said it was all made
with too much attention to effect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and besides,
"had I not a bow of ribbon at my neck?"</p>
<p id="id02438">"And if you condemn a bow of ribbon for a lady,
Monsieur, you would necessarily disapprove of a thing like this for
a gentleman?"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;holding up my bright little
chainlet of silk and gold. His sole reply was a
groan&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I suppose over my levity.</p>
<p id="id02439">After sitting some minutes in silence, and watching
the progress of the chain, at which I now wrought more assiduously
than ever, he inquired: "Whether what he had just said would have
the effect of making me entirely detest him?"</p>
<p id="id02440">I hardly remember what answer I made, or how it
came about; I don't think I spoke at all, but I know we managed to
bid good-night on friendly terms: and, even after M. Paul had
reached the door, he turned back just to explain, "that he would
not be understood to speak in entire condemnation of the scarlet
dress" ("Pink! pink!" I threw in); "that he had no intention to
deny it the merit of <i>looking</i> rather well" (the fact was, M.
Emanuel's taste in colours decidedly leaned to the brilliant);
"only he wished to counsel me, whenever, I wore it, to do so in the
same spirit as if its material were 'bure,' and its hue 'gris de
poussi&Atilde;&uml;re.'"</p>
<p id="id02441">"And the flowers under my bonnet, Monsieur?" I
asked. "They are very little ones&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id02442">"Keep them little, then," said he. "Permit them not
to become full-blown."</p>
<p id="id02443">"And the bow, Monsieur&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the bit
of ribbon?"</p>
<p id="id02444">"Va pour le ruban!" was the propitious answer.</p>
<p id="id02445">And so we settled it.</p>
<p id="id02446">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id02447">"Well done, Lucy Snowe!" cried I to myself; "you
have come in for a pretty lecture&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;brought on
yourself a 'rude savant,' and all through your wicked fondness for
worldly vanities! Who would have thought it? You deemed yourself a
melancholy sober-sides enough! Miss Fanshawe there regards you as a
second Diogenes. M. de Bassompierre, the other day, politely turned
the conversation when it ran on the wild gifts of the actress
Vashti, because, as he kindly said, 'Miss Snowe looked
uncomfortable.' Dr. John Bretton knows you only as 'quiet
Lucy'&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;'a creature inoffensive as a shadow;' he
has said, and you have heard him say it: 'Lucy's disadvantages
spring from over-gravity in tastes and
manner&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;want of colour in character and costume.'
Such are your own and your friends' impressions; and behold! there
starts up a little man, differing diametrically from all these,
roundly charging you with being too airy and
cheery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too volatile and
versatile&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too flowery and coloury. This harsh
little man&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this pitiless
censor&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gathers up all your poor scattered sins
of vanity, your luckless chiffon of rose-colour, your small fringe
of a wreath, your small scrap of ribbon, your silly bit of lace,
and calls you to account for the lot, and for each item. You are
well habituated to be passed by as a shadow in Life's sunshine: it
its a new thing to see one testily lifting his hand to screen his
eyes, because you tease him with an obtrusive ray."</p>
<h2 id="id02448" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h5 id="id02449">MONSIEUR'S F&Atilde;&Scaron;TE.</h5>
<p id="id02450" style="margin-top: 2em">I was up the next morning
an hour before daybreak, and finished my guard, kneeling on the
dormitory floor beside the centre stand, for the benefit of such
expiring glimmer as the night-lamp afforded in its last watch.</p>
<p id="id02451">All my materials&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my whole stock
of beads and silk&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were used up before the chain
assumed the length and richness I wished; I had wrought it double,
as I knew, by the rule of contraries, that to, suit the particular
taste whose gratification was in view, an effective appearance was
quite indispensable. As a finish to the ornament, a little gold
clasp was needed; fortunately I possessed it in the fastening of my
sole necklace; I duly detached and re-attached it, then coiled
compactly the completed guard; and enclosed it in a small box I had
bought for its brilliancy, made of some tropic shell of the colour
called "nacarat," and decked with a little coronal of sparkling
blue stones. Within the lid of the box, I carefully graved with my
scissors' point certain initials.</p>
<p id="id02452">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id02453">The reader will, perhaps, remember the description
of Madame Beck's f&Atilde;&ordf;te; nor will he have forgotten that
at each anniversary, a handsome present was subscribed for and
offered by the school. The observance of this day was a distinction
accorded to none but Madame, and, in a modified form, to her
kinsman and counsellor, M. Emanuel. In the latter case it was an
honour spontaneously awarded, not plotted and contrived beforehand,
and offered an additional proof, amongst many others, of the
estimation in which&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;despite his partialities,
prejudices, and irritabilities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the professor of
literature was held by his pupils. No article of value was offered
to him: he distinctly gave it to be understood, that he would
accept neither plate nor jewellery. Yet he liked a slight tribute;
the cost, the money-value, did not touch him: a diamond ring, a
gold snuff-box, presented, with pomp, would have pleased him less
than a flower, or a drawing, offered simply and with sincere
feelings. Such was his nature. He was a man, not wise in his
generation, yet could he claim a filial sympathy with "the
dayspring on high."</p>
<p id="id02454">M. Paul's f&Atilde;&ordf;te fell on the first of
March and a Thursday. It proved a fine sunny day; and being
likewise the morning on which it was customary to attend mass;
being also otherwise distinguished by the half-holiday which
permitted the privilege of walking out, shopping, or paying visits
in the afternoon: these combined considerations induced a general
smartness and freshness of dress. Clean collars were in vogue; the
ordinary dingy woollen classe-dress was exchanged for something
lighter and clearer. Mademoiselle Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St. Pierre, on
this particular Thursday, even assumed a "robe de soie," deemed in
economical Labassecour an article of hazardous splendour and
luxury; nay, it was remarked that she sent for a "coiffeur" to
dress her hair that morning; there were pupils acute enough to
discover that she had bedewed her handkerchief and her hands with a
new and fashionable perfume. Poor Z&Atilde;&copy;lie! It was much
her wont to declare about this time, that she was tired to death of
a life of seclusion and labour; that she longed to have the means
and leisure for relaxation; to have some one to work for
her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a husband who would pay her debts (she was
woefully encumbered with debt), supply her wardrobe, and leave her
at liberty, as she said, to "go&Atilde;&raquo;ter un peu les
plaisirs." It had long been rumoured, that her eye was upon M.
Emanuel. Monsieur Emanuel's eye was certainly often upon her. He
would sit and watch her perseveringly for minutes together. I have
seen him give her a quarter-of-an-hour's gaze, while the class was
silently composing, and he sat throned on his estrade, unoccupied.
Conscious always of this basilisk attention, she would writhe under
it, half-flattered, half-puzzled, and Monsieur would follow her
sensations, sometimes looking appallingly acute; for in some cases,
he had the terrible unerring penetration of instinct, and pierced
in its hiding-place the last lurking thought of the heart, and
discerned under florid veilings the bare; barren places of the
spirit: yes, and its perverted tendencies, and its hidden false
curves&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all that men and women would not have
known&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the twisted spine, the malformed limb that
was born with them, and far worse, the stain or disfigurement they
have perhaps brought on themselves. No calamity so accursed but M.
Emanuel could pity and forgive, if it were acknowledged candidly;
but where his questioning eyes met dishonest
denial&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where his ruthless researches found
deceitful concealment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oh, then, he could be
cruel, and I thought wicked! he would exultantly snatch the screen
from poor shrinking wretches, passionately hurry them to the summit
of the mount of exposure, and there show them all naked, all
false&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;poor living lies&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
spawn of that horrid Truth which cannot be looked on unveiled. He
thought he did justice; for my part I doubt whether man has a right
to do such justice on man: more than once in these his visitations,
I have felt compelled to give tears to his victims, and not spared
ire and keen reproach to himself. He deserved it; but it was
difficult to shake him in his firm conviction that the work was
righteous and needed.</p>
<p id="id02455">Breakfast being over and mass attended, the
school-bell rang and the rooms filled: a very pretty spectacle was
presented in classe. Pupils and teachers sat neatly arrayed,
orderly and expectant, each bearing in her hand the bouquet of
felicitation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the prettiest spring-flowers all
fresh, and filling the air with their fragrance: I only had no
bouquet. I like to see flowers growing, but when they are gathered,
they cease to please. I look on them as things rootless and
perishable; their likeness to life makes me sad. I never offer
flowers to those I love; I never wish to receive them from hands
dear to me. Mademoiselle St. Pierre marked my empty
hands&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she could not believe I had been so
remiss; with avidity her eye roved over and round me: surely I must
have some solitary symbolic flower somewhere: some small knot of
violets, something to win myself praise for taste, commendation for
ingenuity. The unimaginative "Anglaise" proved better than the
Parisienne's fears: she sat literally unprovided, as bare of bloom
or leaf as the winter tree. This ascertained, Z&Atilde;&copy;lie
smiled, well pleased.</p>
<p id="id02456">"How wisely you have acted to keep your money, Miss
Lucie," she said: "silly I have gone and thrown away two francs on
a bouquet of hot-house flowers!"</p>
<p id="id02457">And she showed with pride her splendid nosegay.</p>
<p id="id02458">But hush! a step: <i>the</i> step. It came prompt,
as usual, but with a promptitude, we felt disposed to flatter
ourselves, inspired by other feelings than mere excitability of
nerve and vehemence of intent. We thought our Professor's
"foot-fall" (to speak romantically) had in it a friendly promise
this morning; and so it had.</p>
<p id="id02459">He entered in a mood which made him as good as a
new sunbeam to the already well-lit first classe. The morning light
playing amongst our plants and laughing on our walls, caught an
added lustre from M. Paul's all-benignant salute. Like a true
Frenchman (though I don't know why I should say so, for he was of
strain neither French nor Labassecourien), he had dressed for the
"situation" and the occasion. Not by the vague folds, sinister and
conspirator-like, of his soot-dark palet&Atilde;&acute;t were the
outlines of his person obscured; on the contrary, his figure (such
as it was, I don't boast of it) was well set off by a civilized
coat and a silken vest quite pretty to behold. The defiant and
pagan bonnet-grec had vanished: bare-headed, he came upon us,
carrying a Christian hat in his gloved hand. The little man looked
well, very well; there was a clearness of amity in his blue eye,
and a glow of good feeling on his dark complexion, which passed
perfectly in the place of beauty: one really did not care to
observe that his nose, though far from small, was of no particular
shape, his cheek thin, his brow marked and square, his mouth no
rose-bud: one accepted him as he was, and felt his presence the
reverse of damping or insignificant.</p>
<p id="id02460">He passed to his desk; he placed on the same his
hat and gloves. "Bon jour, mes amies," said he, in a tone that
somehow made amends to some amongst us for many a sharp snap and
savage snarl: not a jocund, good-fellow tone, still less an
unctuous priestly, accent, but a voice he had belonging to
himself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a voice used when his heart passed the
words to his lips. That same heart did speak sometimes; though an
irritable, it was not an ossified organ: in its core was a place,
tender beyond a man's tenderness; a place that humbled him to
little children, that bound him to girls and women to whom, rebel
as he would, he could not disown his affinity, nor quite deny that,
on the whole, he was better with them than with his own sex.</p>
<p id="id02461">"We all wish Monsieur a good day, and present to
him our congratulations on the anniversary of his
f&Atilde;&ordf;te," said Mademoiselle Z&Atilde;&copy;lie,
constituting herself spokeswoman of the assembly; and advancing
with no more twists of affectation than were with her indispensable
to the achievement of motion, she laid her costly bouquet before
him. He bowed over it.</p>
<p id="id02462">The long train of offerings followed: all the
pupils, sweeping past with the gliding step foreigners practise,
left their tributes as they went by. Each girl so dexterously
adjusted her separate gift, that when the last bouquet was laid on
the desk, it formed the apex to a blooming
pyramid&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a pyramid blooming, spreading, and
towering with such exuberance as, in the end, to eclipse the hero
behind it. This ceremony over, seats were resumed, and we sat in
dead silence, expectant of a speech.</p>
<p id="id02463">I suppose five minutes might have elapsed, and the
hush remained unbroken; ten&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and there was no
sound.</p>
<p id="id02464">Many present began, doubtless, to wonder for what
Monsieur waited; as well they might. Voiceless and viewless,
stirless and wordless, he kept his station behind the pile of
flowers.</p>
<p id="id02465">At last there issued forth a voice, rather deep, as
if it spoke out of a hollow:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02466">"Est-ce l&Atilde;&nbsp; tout?"</p>
<p id="id02467">Mademoiselle Z&Atilde;&copy;lie looked round.</p>
<p id="id02468">"You have all presented your bouquets?" inquired
she of the pupils.</p>
<p id="id02469">Yes; they had all given their nosegays, from the
eldest to the youngest, from the tallest to the most diminutive.
The senior mistress signified as much.</p>
<p id="id02470">"Est-ce l&Atilde;&nbsp; tout?" was reiterated in an
intonation which, deep before, had now descended some notes
lower.</p>
<p id="id02471">"Monsieur," said Mademoiselle St. Pierre, rising,
and this time speaking with her own sweet smile, "I have the honour
to tell you that, with a single exception, every person in classe
has offered her bouquet. For Meess Lucie, Monsieur will kindly make
allowance; as a foreigner she probably did not know our customs, or
did not appreciate their significance. Meess Lucie has regarded
this ceremony as too frivolous to be honoured by her
observance."</p>
<p id="id02472">"Famous!" I muttered between my teeth: "you are no
bad speaker, Z&Atilde;&copy;lie, when you begin."</p>
<p id="id02473">The answer vouchsafed to Mademoiselle St Pierre
from the estrade was given in the gesticulation of a hand from
behind the pyramid. This manual action seemed to deprecate words,
to enjoin silence.</p>
<p id="id02474">A form, ere long, followed the hand. Monsieur
emerged from his eclipse; and producing himself on the front of his
estrade, and gazing straight and fixedly before him at a vast
"mappe-monde" covering the wall opposite, he demanded a third time,
and now in really tragic tones&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02475">"Est-ce l&Atilde;&nbsp; tout?"</p>
<p id="id02476">I might yet have made all right, by stepping
forwards and slipping into his hand the ruddy little shell-box I at
that moment held tight in my own. It was what I had fully purposed
to do; but, first, the comic side of Monsieur's behaviour had
tempted me to delay, and now, Mademoiselle St. Pierre's affected
interference provoked contumacity. The reader not having hitherto
had any cause to ascribe to Miss Snowe's character the most distant
pretensions to perfection, will be scarcely surprised to learn that
she felt too perverse to defend herself from any imputation the
Parisienne might choose to insinuate and besides, M. Paul was so
tragic, and took my defection so seriously, he deserved to be
vexed. I kept, then, both my box and my countenance, and sat
insensate as any stone.</p>
<p id="id02477">"It is well!" dropped at length from the lips of M.
Paul; and having uttered this phrase, the shadow of some great
paroxysm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the swell of wrath, scorn,
resolve&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;passed over his brow, rippled his lips,
and lined his cheeks. Gulping down all further comment, he launched
into his customary "discours."</p>
<p id="id02478">I can't at all remember what this "discours" was; I
did not listen to it: the gulping-down process, the abrupt
dismissal of his mortification or vexation, had given me a
sensation which half-counteracted the ludicrous effect of the
reiterated "Est-ce l&Atilde;&nbsp; tout?"</p>
<p id="id02479">Towards the close of the speech there came a
pleasing diversion my attention was again amusingly arrested.</p>
<p id="id02480">Owing to some little accidental
movement&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I think I dropped my thimble on the
floor, and in stooping to regain it, hit the crown of my head
against the sharp corner of my desk; which casualties (exasperating
to me, by rights, if to anybody) naturally made a slight
bustle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;M. Paul became irritated, and dismissing
his forced equanimity, and casting to the winds that dignity and
self-control with which he never cared long to encumber himself, he
broke forth into the strain best calculated to give him ease.</p>
<p id="id02481">I don't know how, in the progress of his
"discours," he had contrived to cross the Channel and land on
British ground; but there I found him when I began to listen.</p>
<p id="id02482">Casting a quick, cynical glance round the
room&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a glance which scathed, or was intended to
scathe, as it crossed me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he fell with fury upon
"les Anglaises."</p>
<p id="id02483">Never have I heard English women handled as M. Paul
that morning handled them: he spared
nothing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;neither their minds, morals, manners,
nor personal appearance. I specially remember his abuse of their
tall stature, their long necks, their thin arms, their slovenly
dress, their pedantic education, their impious scepticism(!), their
insufferable pride, their pretentious virtue: over which he ground
his teeth malignantly, and looked as if, had he dared, he would
have said singular things. Oh! he was spiteful, acrid, savage; and,
as a natural consequence, detestably ugly.</p>
<p id="id02484">"Little wicked venomous man!" thought I; "am I
going to harass myself with fears of displeasing you, or hurting
your feelings? No, indeed; you shall be indifferent to me, as the
shabbiest bouquet in your pyramid."</p>
<p id="id02485">I grieve to say I could not quite carry out this
resolution. For some time the abuse of England and the English
found and left me stolid: I bore it some fifteen minutes stoically
enough; but this hissing cockatrice was determined to sting, and he
said such things at last&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fastening not only upon
our women, but upon our greatest names and best men; sullying, the
shield of Britannia, and dabbling the union jack in
mud&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that I was stung. With vicious relish he
brought up the most spicy current continental historical
falsehoods&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;than which nothing can be conceived
more offensive. Z&Atilde;&copy;lie, and the whole class, became one
grin of vindictive delight; for it is curious to discover how these
clowns of Labassecour secretly hate England. At last, I struck a
sharp stroke on my desk, opened my lips, and let loose this
cry:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02486">"Vive l'Angleterre, l'Histoire et les
H&Atilde;&copy;ros! A bas la France, la<br />
Fiction et les Faquins!"<br /></p>
<p id="id02487">The class was struck of a heap. I suppose they
thought me mad. The Professor put up his handkerchief, and
fiendishly smiled into its folds. Little monster of malice! He now
thought he had got the victory, since he had made me angry. In a
second he became good-humoured. With great blandness he resumed the
subject of his flowers; talked poetically and symbolically of their
sweetness, perfume, purity, etcetera; made Frenchified comparisons
between the "jeunes filles" and the sweet blossoms before him; paid
Mademoiselle St. Pierre a very full-blown compliment on the
superiority of her bouquet; and ended by announcing that the first
really fine, mild, and balmy morning in spring, he intended to take
the whole class out to breakfast in the country. "Such of the
class, at least," he added, with emphasis, "as he could count
amongst the number of his friends."</p>
<p id="id02488">"Donc je n'y serai pas," declared I,
involuntarily.</p>
<p id="id02489">"Soit!" was his response; and, gathering his
flowers in his arms, he flashed out of classe; while I, consigning
my work, scissors, thimble, and the neglected little box, to my
desk, swept up-stairs. I don't know whether <i>he</i> felt hot and
angry, but I am free to confess that <i>I</i> did.</p>
<p id="id02490">Yet with a strange evanescent anger, I had not sat
an hour on the edge of my bed, picturing and repicturing his look,
manner, words ere I smiled at the whole scene. A little pang of
regret I underwent that the box had not been offered. I had meant
to gratify him. Fate would not have it so.</p>
<p id="id02491">In the course of the afternoon, remembering that
desks in classe were by no means inviolate repositories, and
thinking that it was as well to secure the box, on account of the
initials in the lid, P. C. D. E., for Paul Carl (or Carlos) David
Emanuel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such was his full
name&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these foreigners must always have a string
of baptismals&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I descended to the schoolroom.</p>
<p id="id02492">It slept in holiday repose. The day pupils were all
gone home, the boarders were out walking, the teachers, except the
surveillante of the week, were in town, visiting or shopping; the
suite of divisions was vacant; so was the grande salle, with its
huge solemn globe hanging in the midst, its pair of many-branched
chandeliers, and its horizontal grand piano closed, silent,
enjoying its mid-week Sabbath. I rather wondered to find the first
classe door ajar; this room being usually locked when empty, and
being then inaccessible to any save Madame Beck and myself, who
possessed a duplicate key. I wondered still more, on approaching,
to hear a vague movement as of life&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a step, a
chair stirred, a sound like the opening of a desk.</p>
<p id="id02493">"It is only Madame Beck doing inspection duty," was
the conclusion following a moment's reflection. The
partially-opened door gave opportunity for assurance on this point.
I looked. Behold! not the inspecting garb of Madame
Beck&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the shawl and the clean
cap&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but the coat, and the close-shorn, dark head
of a man. This person occupied my chair; his olive hand held my
desk open, his nose was lost to view amongst my papers. His back
was towards me, but there could not be a moment's question about
identity. Already was the attire of ceremony discarded: the
cherished and ink-stained palet&Atilde;&acute;t was resumed; the
perverse bonnet-grec lay on the floor, as if just dropped from the
hand, culpably busy.</p>
<p id="id02494">Now I knew, and I had long known, that that hand of
M. Emanuel's was on the most intimate terms with my desk; that it
raised and lowered the lid, ransacked and arranged the contents,
almost as familiarly as my own. The fact was not dubious, nor did
he wish it to be so: he left signs of each visit palpable and
unmistakable; hitherto, however, I had never caught him in the act:
watch as I would, I could not detect the hours and moments of his
coming. I saw the brownie's work in exercises left overnight full
of faults, and found next morning carefully corrected: I profited
by his capricious good-will in loans full welcome and refreshing.
Between a sallow dictionary and worn-out grammar would magically
grow a fresh interesting new work, or a classic, mellow and sweet
in its ripe age. Out of my work-basket would laughingly peep a
romance, under it would lurk the pamphlet, the magazine, whence
last evening's reading had been extracted. Impossible to doubt the
source whence these treasures flowed: had there been no other
indication, one condemning and traitor peculiarity, common to them
all, settled the question&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>they smelt of
cigars</i>. This was very shocking, of course: <i>I</i> thought so
at first, and used to open the window with some bustle, to air my
desk, and with fastidious finger and thumb, to hold the peccant
brochures forth to the purifying breeze. I was cured of that
formality suddenly. Monsieur caught me at it one day, understood
the inference, instantly relieved my hand of its burden, and, in
another moment, would have thrust the same into the glowing stove.
It chanced to be a book, on the perusal of which I was bent; so for
once I proved as decided and quicker than himself; recaptured the
spoil, and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;having saved this
volume&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;never hazarded a second. With all this, I
had never yet been able to arrest in his visits the freakish,
friendly, cigar-loving phantom.</p>
<p id="id02495">But now at last I had him: there he
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the very brownie himself; and there, curling
from his lips, was the pale blue breath of his Indian darling: he
was smoking into my desk: it might well betray him. Provoked at
this particular, and yet pleased to surprise
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pleased, that is, with the mixed feeling of
the housewife who discovers at last her strange elfin ally busy in
the dairy at the untimely churn&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I softly stole
forward, stood behind him, bent with precaution over his
shoulder.</p>
<p id="id02496">My heart smote me to see
that&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;after this morning's hostility, after my
seeming remissness, after the puncture experienced by his feelings,
and the ruffling undergone by his temper&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he, all
willing to forget and forgive, had brought me a couple of handsome
volumes, of which the title and authorship were guarantees for
interest. Now, as he sat bending above the desk, he was stirring up
its contents; but with gentle and careful hand; disarranging
indeed, but not harming. My heart smote me: as I bent over him, as
he sat unconscious, doing me what good he could, and I daresay not
feeling towards me unkindly, my morning's anger quite melted: I did
not dislike Professor Emanuel.</p>
<p id="id02497">I think he heard me breathe. He turned suddenly:
his temperament was nervous, yet he never started, and seldom
changed colour: there was something hardy about him.</p>
<p id="id02498">"I thought you were gone into town with the other
teachers," said he, taking a grim gripe of his self-possession,
which half-escaped him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"It is as well you are
not. Do you think I care for being caught? Not I. I often visit
your desk."</p>
<p id="id02499">"Monsieur, I know it."</p>
<p id="id02500">"You find a brochure or tome now and then; but you
don't read them, because they have passed under
this?"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;touching his cigar.</p>
<p id="id02501">"They have, and are no better for the process; but
I read them."</p>
<p id="id02502">"Without pleasure?"</p>
<p id="id02503">"Monsieur must not be contradicted."</p>
<p id="id02504">"Do you like them, or any of
them?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;are they acceptable?" "Monsieur has seen
me reading them a hundred times, and knows I have not so many
recreations as to undervalue those he provides."</p>
<p id="id02505">"I mean well; and, if you see that I mean well, and
derive some little amusement from my efforts, why can we not be
friends?"</p>
<p id="id02506">"A fatalist would say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;because we
cannot."</p>
<p id="id02507">"This morning," he continued, "I awoke in a bright
mood, and came into classe happy; you spoiled my day."</p>
<p id="id02508">"No, Monsieur, only an hour or two of it, and that
unintentionally."</p>
<p id="id02509">"Unintentionally! No. It was my
f&Atilde;&ordf;te-day; everybody wished me happiness but you. The
little children of the third division gave each her knot of
violets, lisped each her
congratulation:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing.
Not a bud, leaf, whisper&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not a glance. Was this
unintentional?"</p>
<p id="id02510">"I meant no harm."</p>
<p id="id02511">"Then you really did not know our custom? You were
unprepared? You would willingly have laid out a few centimes on a
flower to give me pleasure, had you been aware that it was
expected? Say so, and all is forgotten, and the pain soothed."</p>
<p id="id02512">"I did know that it was expected: I <i>was</i>
prepared; yet I laid out no centimes on flowers."</p>
<p id="id02513">"It is well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you do right to be
honest. I should almost have hated you had you flattered and lied.
Better declare at once 'Paul Carl Emanuel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;je te
d&Atilde;&copy;teste, mon
gar&Atilde;&sect;on!'&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;than smile an interest,
look an affection, and be false and cold at heart. False and cold I
don't think you are; but you have made a great mistake in life,
that I believe; I think your judgment is
warped&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that you are indifferent where you ought
to be grateful&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and perhaps devoted and
infatuated, where you ought to be cool as your name. Don't suppose
that I wish you to have a passion for me, Mademoiselle; Dieu vous
en garde! What do you start for? Because I said passion? Well, I
say it again. There is such a word, and there is such a
thing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though not within these walls, thank
heaven! You are no child that one should not speak of what exists;
but I only uttered the word&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the thing, I assure
you, is alien to my whole life and views. It died in the
past&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in the present it lies
buried&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;its grave is deep-dug, well-heaped, and
many winters old: in the future there will be a resurrection, as I
believe to my souls consolation; but all will then be
changed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;form and feeling: the mortal will have
put on immortality&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it will rise, not for earth,
but heaven. All I say to <i>you</i>, Miss Lucy Snowe,
is&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that you ought to treat Professor Paul
Emanuel decently."</p>
<p id="id02514">I could not, and did not contradict such a
sentiment.</p>
<p id="id02515">"Tell me," he pursued, "when it is <i>your</i>
f&Atilde;&ordf;te-day, and I will not grudge a few centimes for a
small offering."</p>
<p id="id02516">"You will be like me, Monsieur: this cost more than
a few centimes, and<br />
I did not grudge its price."<br /></p>
<p id="id02517">And taking from the open desk the little box, I put
it into his hand.</p>
<p id="id02518">"It lay ready in my lap this morning," I continued;
"and if Monsieur had been rather more patient, and Mademoiselle St.
Pierre less interfering&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps I should say,
too, if <i>I</i> had been calmer and wiser&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
should have given it then."</p>
<p id="id02519">He looked at the box: I saw its clear warm tint and
bright azure circlet, pleased his eyes. I told him to open it.</p>
<p id="id02520">"My initials!" said he, indicating the letters in
the lid. "Who told you I was called Carl David?"</p>
<p id="id02521">"A little bird, Monsieur."</p>
<p id="id02522">"Does it fly from me to you? Then one can tie a
message under its wing when needful.",</p>
<p id="id02523">He took out the chain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a trifle
indeed as to value, but glossy with silk and sparkling with beads.
He liked that too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;admired it artlessly, like a
child.</p>
<p id="id02524">"For me?"</p>
<p id="id02525">"Yes, for you."</p>
<p id="id02526">"This is the thing you were working at last
night?"</p>
<p id="id02527">"The same."</p>
<p id="id02528">"You finished it this morning?"</p>
<p id="id02529">"I did."</p>
<p id="id02530">"You commenced it with the intention that it should
be mine?"</p>
<p id="id02531">"Undoubtedly."</p>
<p id="id02532">"And offered on my f&Atilde;&ordf;te-day?"</p>
<p id="id02533">"Yes."</p>
<p id="id02534">"This purpose continued as you wove it?"</p>
<p id="id02535">Again I assented.</p>
<p id="id02536">"Then it is not necessary that I should cut out any
portion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;saying, this part is not mine: it was
plaited under the idea and for the adornment of another?"</p>
<p id="id02537">"By no means. It is neither necessary, nor would it
be just."</p>
<p id="id02538">"This object is <i>all</i> mine?"</p>
<p id="id02539">"That object is yours entirely."</p>
<p id="id02540">Straightway Monsieur opened his
palet&Atilde;&acute;t, arranged the guard splendidly across his
chest, displaying as much and suppressing as little as he could:
for he had no notion of concealing what he admired and thought
decorative. As to the box, he pronounced it a superb
bonbonni&Atilde;&uml;re&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was fond of bonbons,
by the way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and as he always liked to share with
others what pleased himself, he would give his
"drag&Atilde;&copy;es" as freely as he lent his books. Amongst the
kind brownie's gifts left in my desk, I forgot to enumerate many a
paper of chocolate comfits. His tastes in these matters were
southern, and what we think infantine. His simple lunch consisted
frequently of a "brioche," which, as often as not, to shared with
some child of the third division.</p>
<p id="id02541">"A pr&Atilde;&copy;sent c'est un fait accompli,"
said he, re-adjusting his palet&Atilde;&acute;t; and we had no more
words on the subject. After looking over the two volumes he had
brought, and cutting away some pages with his penknife (he
generally pruned before lending his books, especially if they were
novels, and sometimes I was a little provoked at the severity of
his censorship, the retrenchments interrupting the narrative), he
rose, politely touched his bonnet-grec, and bade me a civil
good-day.</p>
<p id="id02542">"We are friends now," thought I, "till the next
time we quarrel."</p>
<p id="id02543">We <i>might</i> have quarrelled again that very
same evening, but, wonderful to relate, failed, for once, to make
the most of our opportunity.</p>
<p id="id02544">Contrary to all expectation, M. Paul arrived at the
study-hour. Having seen so much of him in the morning, we did not
look for his presence at night. No sooner were we seated at
lessons, however, than he appeared. I own I was glad to see him, so
glad that I could not help greeting his arrival with a smile; and
when he made his way to the same seat about which so serious a
misunderstanding had formerly arisen, I took good care not to make
too much room for him; he watched with a jealous, side-long look,
to see whether I shrank away, but I did not, though the bench was a
little crowded. I was losing the early impulse to recoil from M.
Paul. Habituated to the palet&Atilde;&acute;t and bonnet-grec, the
neighbourhood of these garments seemed no longer uncomfortable or
very formidable. I did not now sit restrained,
"asphyxi&Atilde;&copy;e" (as he used to say) at his side; I stirred
when I wished to stir, coughed when it was necessary, even yawned
when I was tired&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;did, in short, what I pleased,
blindly reliant upon his indulgence. Nor did my temerity, this
evening at least, meet the punishment it perhaps merited; he was
both indulgent and good-natured; not a cross glance shot from his
eyes, not a hasty word left his lips. Till the very close of the
evening, he did not indeed address me at all, yet I felt, somehow,
that he was full of friendliness. Silence is of different kinds,
and breathes different meanings; no words could inspire a
pleasanter content than did M. Paul's worldless presence. When the
tray came in, and the bustle of supper commenced, he just said, as
he retired, that he wished me a good night and sweet dreams; and a
good night and sweet dreams I had.</p>
<h2 id="id02545" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h5 id="id02546">M. PAUL.</h5>
<p id="id02547" style="margin-top: 2em">Yet the reader is advised
not to be in any hurry with his kindly conclusions, or to suppose,
with an over-hasty charity, that from that day M. Paul became a
changed character&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;easy to live with, and no
longer apt to flash danger and discomfort round him.</p>
<p id="id02548">No; he was naturally a little man of unreasonable
moods. When over-wrought, which he often was, he became acutely
irritable; and, besides, his veins were dark with a livid
belladonna tincture, the essence of jealousy. I do not mean merely
the tender jealousy of the heart, but that sterner, narrower
sentiment whose seat is in the head.</p>
<p id="id02549">I used to think, as I Sat looking at M. Paul, while
he was knitting his brow or protruding his lip over some exercise
of mine, which had not as many faults as he wished (for he liked me
to commit faults: a knot of blunders was sweet to him as a cluster
of nuts), that he had points of resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte.
I think so still.</p>
<p id="id02550">In a shameless disregard of magnanimity, he
resembled the great Emperor. M. Paul would have quarrelled with
twenty learned women, would have unblushingly carried on a system
of petty bickering and recrimination with a whole capital of
coteries, never troubling himself about loss or lack of dignity. He
would have exiled fifty Madame de Sta&Atilde;&laquo;ls, if, they
had annoyed, offended, outrivalled, or opposed him.</p>
<p id="id02551">I well remember a hot episode of his with a certain
Madame Panache&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a lady temporarily employed by
Madame Beck to give lessons in history. She was
clever&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is, she knew a good deal; and,
besides, thoroughly possessed the art of making the most of what
she knew; of words and confidence she held unlimited command. Her
personal appearance was far from destitute of advantages; I believe
many people would have pronounced her "a fine woman;" and yet there
were points in her robust and ample attractions, as well as in her
bustling and demonstrative presence, which, it appeared, the nice
and capricious tastes of M. Paul could not away with. The sound of
her voice, echoing through the carr&Atilde;&copy;, would put him
into a strange taking; her long free step&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost
stride&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;along the corridor, would often make him
snatch up his papers and decamp on the instant.</p>
<p id="id02552">With malicious intent he bethought himself, one
day, to intrude on her class; as quick as lightning he gathered her
method of instruction; it differed from a pet plan of his own. With
little ceremony, and less courtesy, he pointed out what he termed
her errors. Whether he expected submission and attention, I know
not; he met an acrid opposition, accompanied by a round reprimand
for his certainly unjustifiable interference.</p>
<p id="id02553">Instead of withdrawing with dignity, as he might
still have done, he threw down the gauntlet of defiance. Madame
Panache, bellicose as a Penthesilea, picked it up in a minute. She
snapped her fingers in the intermeddler's face; she rushed upon him
with a storm of words. M. Emanuel was eloquent; but Madame Panache
was voluble. A system of fierce antagonism ensued. Instead of
laughing in his sleeve at his fair foe, with all her sore
amour-propre and loud self-assertion, M. Paul detested her with
intense seriousness; he honoured her with his earnest fury; he
pursued her vindictively and implacably, refusing to rest peaceably
in his bed, to derive due benefit from his meals, or even serenely
to relish his cigar, till she was fairly rooted out of the
establishment. The Professor conquered, but I cannot say that the
laurels of this victory shadowed gracefully his temples. Once I
ventured to hint as much. To my great surprise he allowed that I
might be right, but averred that when brought into contact with
either men or women of the coarse, self-complacent quality, whereof
Madame Panache was a specimen, he had no control over his own
passions; an unspeakable and active aversion impelled him to a war
of extermination.</p>
<p id="id02554">Three months afterwards, hearing that his
vanquished foe had met with reverses, and was likely to be really
distressed for want of employment, he forgot his hatred, and alike
active in good and evil, he moved heaven and earth till he found
her a place. Upon her coming to make up former differences, and
thank him for his recent kindness, the old
voice&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a little loud&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the old
manner&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a little forward&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so
acted upon him that in ten minutes he started up and bowed her, or
rather himself, out of the room, in a transport of nervous
irritation.</p>
<p id="id02555">To pursue a somewhat audacious parallel, in a love
of power, in an eager grasp after supremacy, M. Emanuel was like
Bonaparte. He was a man not always to be submitted to. Sometimes it
was needful to resist; it was right to stand still, to look up into
his eyes and tell him that his requirements went beyond
reason&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that his absolutism verged on
tyranny.</p>
<p id="id02556">The dawnings, the first developments of peculiar
talent appearing within his range, and under his rule, curiously
excited, even disturbed him. He watched its struggle into life with
a scowl; he held back his hand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps said,
"Come on if you have strength," but would not aid the birth.</p>
<p id="id02557">When the pang and peril of the first conflict were
over, when the breath of life was drawn, when he saw the lungs
expand and contract, when he felt the heart beat and discovered
life in the eye, he did not yet offer to foster.</p>
<p id="id02558">"Prove yourself true ere I cherish you," was his
ordinance; and how difficult he made that proof! What thorns and
briers, what flints, he strewed in the path of feet not inured to
rough travel! He watched tearlessly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;ordeals that
he exacted should be passed through&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fearlessly.
He followed footprints that, as they approached the bourne, were
sometimes marked in blood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;followed them grimly,
holding the austerest police-watch over the pain-pressed pilgrim.
And when at last he allowed a rest, before slumber might close the
eyelids, he opened those same lids wide, with pitiless finger and
thumb, and gazed deep through the pupil and the irids into the
brain, into the heart, to search if Vanity, or Pride, or Falsehood,
in any of its subtlest forms, was discoverable in the furthest
recess of existence. If, at last, he let the neophyte sleep, it was
but a moment; he woke him suddenly up to apply new tests: he sent
him on irksome errands when he was staggering with weariness; he
tried the temper, the sense, and the health; and it was only when
every severest test had been applied and endured, when the most
corrosive aquafortis had been used, and failed to tarnish the ore,
that he admitted it genuine, and, still in clouded silence, stamped
it with his deep brand of approval.</p>
<p id="id02559">I speak not ignorant of these evils.</p>
<p id="id02560">Till the date at which the last chapter closes, M.
Paul had not been my professor&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he had not given
me lessons, but about that time, accidentally hearing me one day
acknowledge an ignorance of some branch of education (I think it
was arithmetic), which would have disgraced a charity-school boy,
as he very truly remarked, he took me in hand, examined me first,
found me, I need not say, abundantly deficient, gave me some books
and appointed me some tasks.</p>
<p id="id02561">He did this at first with pleasure, indeed with
unconcealed exultation, condescending to say that he believed I was
"bonne et pas trop faible" (i.e. well enough disposed, and not
wholly destitute of parts), but, owing he supposed to adverse
circumstances, "as yet in a state of wretchedly imperfect mental
development."</p>
<p id="id02562">The beginning of all effort has indeed with me been
marked by a preternatural imbecility. I never could, even in
forming a common acquaintance, assert or prove a claim to average
quickness. A depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every
new page I have turned in life.</p>
<p id="id02563">So long as this passage lasted, M. Paul was very
kind, very good, very forbearing; he saw the sharp pain inflicted,
and felt the weighty humiliation imposed by my own sense of
incapacity; and words can hardly do justice to his tenderness and
helpfulness. His own eyes would moisten, when tears of shame and
effort clouded mine; burdened as he was with work, he would steal
half his brief space of recreation to give to me.</p>
<p id="id02564">But, strange grief! when that heavy and overcast
dawn began at last to yield to day; when my faculties began to
struggle themselves, free, and my time of energy and fulfilment
came; when I voluntarily doubled, trebled, quadrupled the tasks he
set, to please him as I thought, his kindness became sternness; the
light changed in his eyes from a beam to a spark; he fretted, he
opposed, he curbed me imperiously; the more I did, the harder I
worked, the less he seemed content. Sarcasms of which the severity
amazed and puzzled me, harassed my ears; then flowed out the
bitterest inuendoes against the "pride of intellect." I was vaguely
threatened with I know not what doom, if I ever trespassed the
limits proper to my sex, and conceived a contraband appetite for
unfeminine knowledge. Alas! I had no such appetite. What I loved,
it joyed me by any effort to content; but the noble hunger for
science in the abstract&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the godlike thirst after
discovery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these feelings were known to me but by
briefest flashes.</p>
<p id="id02565">Yet, when M. Paul sneered at me, I wanted to
possess them more fully; his injustice stirred in me ambitious
wishes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it imparted a strong
stimulus&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it gave wings to aspiration.</p>
<p id="id02566">In the beginning, before I had penetrated to
motives, that uncomprehended sneer of his made my heart ache, but
by-and-by it only warmed the blood in my veins, and sent added
action to my pulses. Whatever my powers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;feminine
or the contrary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;God had given them, and I felt
resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of his bestowal.</p>
<p id="id02567">The combat was very sharp for a time. I seemed to
have lost M. Paul's affection; he treated me strangely. In his most
unjust moments he would insinuate that I had deceived him when I
appeared, what he called "faible"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is
incompetent; he said I had feigned a false incapacity. Again, he
would turn suddenly round and accuse me of the most far-fetched
imitations and impossible plagiarisms, asserting that I had
extracted the pith out of books I had not so much as heard
of&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and over the perusal of which I should
infallibly have fallen down in a sleep as deep as that of
Eutychus.</p>
<p id="id02568">Once, upon his preferring such an accusation, I
turned upon him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I rose against him. Gathering an
armful of his books out of my desk, I filled my apron and poured
them in a heap upon his estrade, at his feet.</p>
<p id="id02569">"Take them away, M. Paul," I said, "and teach me no
more. I never asked to be made learned, and you compel me to feel
very profoundly that learning is not happiness."</p>
<p id="id02570">And returning to my desk, I laid my head on my
arms, nor would I speak to him for two days afterwards. He pained
and chagrined me. His affection had been very sweet and
dear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a pleasure new and incomparable: now that
this seemed withdrawn, I cared not for his lessons.</p>
<p id="id02571">The books, however, were not taken away; they were
all restored with careful hand to their places, and he came as
usual to teach me. He made his peace somehow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too
readily, perhaps: I ought to have stood out longer, but when he
looked kind and good, and held out his hand with amity, memory
refused to reproduce with due force his oppressive moments. And
then, reconcilement is always sweet!</p>
<p id="id02572">On a certain morning a message came from my
godmother, inviting me to attend some notable lecture to be
delivered in the same public rooms before described. Dr. John had
brought the message himself, and delivered it verbally to Rosine,
who had not scrupled to follow the steps of M. Emanuel, then
passing to the first classe, and, in his presence, stand
"carr&Atilde;&copy;ment" before my desk, hand in apron-pocket, and
rehearse the same, saucily and aloud, concluding with the words,
"Qu'il est vraiment beau, Mademoiselle, ce jeune docteur! Quels
yeux&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quel regard! Tenez! J'en ai le coeur tout
&Atilde;&copy;mu!"</p>
<p id="id02573">When she was gone, my professor demanded of me why
I suffered "cette fille effront&Atilde;&copy;e, cette
cr&Atilde;&copy;ature sans pudeur," to address me in such
terms.</p>
<p id="id02574">I had no pacifying answer to give. The terms were
precisely such as Rosine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a young lady in whose
skull the organs of reverence and reserve were not largely
developed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was in the constant habit of using.
Besides, what she said about the young doctor was true enough.
Graham <i>was</i> handsome; he had fine eyes and a thrilling:
glance. An observation to that effect actually formed itself into
sound on my lips.</p>
<p id="id02575">"Elle ne dit que la
v&Atilde;&copy;rit&Atilde;&copy;," I said.</p>
<p id="id02576">"Ah! vous trouvez?"</p>
<p id="id02577">"Mais, sans doute."</p>
<p id="id02578">The lesson to which we had that day to submit was
such as to make us very glad when it terminated. At its close, the
released, pupils rushed out, half-trembling, half-exultant. I, too,
was going. A mandate to remain arrested me. I muttered that I
wanted some fresh air sadly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the stove was in a
glow, the classe over-heated. An inexorable voice merely
recommended silence; and this salamander&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for
whom no room ever seemed too hot&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sitting down
between my desk and the stove&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a situation in
which he ought to have felt broiled, but did
not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;proceeded to confront me
with&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a Greek quotation!</p>
<p id="id02579">In M. Emanuel's soul rankled a chronic suspicion
that I knew both Greek and Latin. As monkeys are said to have the
power of speech if they would but use it, and are reported to
conceal this faculty in fear of its being turned to their
detriment, so to me was ascribed a fund of knowledge which I was
supposed criminally and craftily to conceal. The privileges of a
"classical education," it was insinuated, had been mine; on flowers
of Hymettus I had revelled; a golden store, hived in memory, now
silently sustained my efforts, and privily nurtured my wits.</p>
<p id="id02580">A hundred expedients did M. Paul employ to surprise
my secret&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to wheedle, to threaten, to startle it
out of me. Sometimes he placed Greek and Latin books in my way, and
then watched me, as Joan of Arc's jailors tempted her with the
warrior's accoutrements, and lay in wait for the issue. Again he
quoted I know not what authors and passages, and while rolling out
their sweet and sounding lines (the classic tones fell musically
from his lips&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for he had a good
voice&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;remarkable for compass, modulation, and
matchless expression), he would fix on me a vigilant, piercing, and
often malicious eye. It was evident he sometimes expected great
demonstrations; they never occurred, however; not comprehending, of
course I could neither be charmed nor annoyed.</p>
<p id="id02581">Baffled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost
angry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he still clung to his fixed idea; my
susceptibilities were pronounced marble&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my face
a mask. It appeared as if he could not be brought to accept the
homely truth, and take me for what I was: men, and women too, must
have delusion of some sort; if not made ready to their hand, they
will invent exaggeration for themselves.</p>
<p id="id02582">At moments I <i>did</i> wish that his suspicions
had been better founded. There were times when I would have given
my right hand to possess the treasures he ascribed to me. He
deserved condign punishment for his testy crotchets. I could have
gloried in bringing home to him his worst apprehensions
astoundingly realized. I could have exulted to burst on his vision,
confront and confound his "lunettes," one blaze of acquirements.
Oh! why did nobody undertake to make me clever while I was young
enough to learn, that I might, by one grand, sudden, inhuman
revelation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one cold, cruel, overwhelming
triumph&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;have for ever crushed the mocking spirit
out of Paul Carl David Emanuel!</p>
<p id="id02583">Alas! no such feat was in my power. To-day, as
usual, his quotations fell ineffectual: he soon shifted his
ground.</p>
<p id="id02584">"Women of intellect" was his next theme: here he
was at home. A "woman of intellect," it appeared, was a sort of
"lusus naturae," a luckless accident, a thing for which there was
neither place nor use in creation, wanted neither as wife nor
worker. Beauty anticipated her in the first office. He believed in
his soul that lovely, placid, and passive feminine mediocrity was
the only pillow on which manly thought and sense could find rest
for its aching temples; and as to work, male mind alone could work
to any good practical result&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hein?</p>
<p id="id02585">This "hein?" was a note of interrogation intended
to draw from me contradiction or objection. However, I only
said&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Cela ne me regarde pas: je ne m'en soucie
pas;" and presently added&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"May I go, Monsieur?
They have rung the bell for the second d&Atilde;&copy;jeuner"
(<i>i.e.</i> luncheon).</p>
<p id="id02586">"What of that? You are not hungry?"</p>
<p id="id02587">"Indeed I was," I said; "I had had nothing since
breakfast, at seven, and should have nothing till dinner, at five,
if I missed this bell."</p>
<p id="id02588">"Well, he was in the same plight, but I might share
with him."</p>
<p id="id02589">And he broke in two the "brioche" intended for his
own refreshment, and gave me half. Truly his bark was worse than
his bite; but the really formidable attack was yet to come. While
eating his cake, I could not forbear expressing my secret wish that
I really knew all of which he accused me.</p>
<p id="id02590">"Did I sincerely feel myself to be an ignoramus?"
he asked, in a softened tone.</p>
<p id="id02591">If I had replied meekly by an unqualified
affirmative, I believe he would have stretched out his hand, and we
should have been friends on the spot, but I
answered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02592">"Not exactly. I am ignorant, Monsieur, in the
knowledge you ascribe to me, but I <i>sometimes</i>, not
<i>always</i>, feel a knowledge of my own."</p>
<p id="id02593">"What did I mean?" he inquired, sharply.</p>
<p id="id02594">Unable to answer this question in a breath, I
evaded it by change of subject. He had now finished his half of the
brioche feeling sure that on so trifling a fragment he could not
have satisfied his appetite, as indeed I had not appeased mine, and
inhaling the fragrance of baked apples afar from the refectory, I
ventured to inquire whether he did not also perceive that agreeable
odour. He confessed that he did. I said if he would let me out by
the garden-door, and permit me just to run across the court, I
would fetch him a plateful; and added that I believed they were
excellent, as Goton had a very good method of baking, or rather
stewing fruit, putting in a little spice, sugar, and a glass or two
of vin blanc&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;might I go?</p>
<p id="id02595">"Petite gourmande!" said he, smiling, "I have not
forgotten how pleased you were with the
p&Atilde;&cent;t&Atilde;&copy; &Atilde;&cent; la cr&Atilde;&ordf;me
I once gave you, and you know very well, at this moment, that to
fetch the apples for me will be the same as getting them for
yourself. Go, then, but come back quickly."</p>
<p id="id02596">And at last he liberated me on parole. My own plan
was to go and return with speed and good faith, to put the plate in
at the door, and then to vanish incontinent, leaving all
consequences for future settlement.</p>
<p id="id02597">That intolerably keen instinct of his seemed to
have anticipated my scheme: he met me at the threshold, hurried me
into the room, and fixed me in a minute in my former seat. Taking
the plate of fruit from my hand, he divided the portion intended
only for himself, and ordered me to eat my share. I complied with
no good grace, and vexed, I suppose, by my reluctance, he opened a
masked and dangerous battery. All he had yet said, I could count as
mere sound and fury, signifying nothing: not so of the present
attack.</p>
<p id="id02598">It consisted in an unreasonable proposition with
which he had before afflicted me: namely, that on the next public
examination-day I should engage&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;foreigner as I
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to take my place on the first form of
first-class pupils, and with them improvise a composition in
French, on any subject any spectator might dictate, without benefit
of grammar or lexicon.</p>
<p id="id02599">I knew what the result of such an experiment would
be. I, to whom nature had denied the impromptu faculty; who, in
public, was by nature a cypher; whose time of mental activity, even
when alone, was not under the meridian sun; who needed the fresh
silence of morning, or the recluse peace of evening, to win from
the Creative Impulse one evidence of his presence, one proof of his
force; I, with whom that Impulse was the most intractable, the most
capricious, the most maddening of masters (him before me always
excepted)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a deity which sometimes, under
circumstances&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;apparently propitious, would not
speak when questioned, would not hear when appealed to, would not,
when sought, be found; but would stand, all cold, all indurated,
all granite, a dark Baal with carven lips and blank eye-balls, and
breast like the stone face of a tomb; and again, suddenly, at some
turn, some sound, some long-trembling sob of the wind, at some
rushing past of an unseen stream of electricity, the irrational
demon would wake unsolicited, would stir strangely alive, would
rush from its pedestal like a perturbed Dagon, calling to its
votary for a sacrifice, whatever the hour&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to its
victim for some blood, or some breath, whatever the circumstance or
scene&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rousing its priest, treacherously
promising vaticination, perhaps filling its temple with a strange
hum of oracles, but sure to give half the significance to fateful
winds, and grudging to the desperate listener even a miserable
remnant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;yielding it sordidly, as though each
word had been a drop of the deathless ichor of its own dark veins.
And this tyrant I was to compel into bondage, and make it improvise
a theme, on a school estrade, between a Mathilde and a Coralie,
under the eye of a Madame Beck, for the pleasure, and to the
inspiration of a bourgeois of Labassecour!</p>
<p id="id02600">Upon this argument M. Paul and I did battle more
than once&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strong battle, with confused noise of
demand and rejection, exaction and repulse.</p>
<p id="id02601">On this particular day I was soundly rated. "The
obstinacy of my whole sex," it seems, was concentrated in me; I had
an "orgueil de diable." I feared to fail, forsooth! What did it
matter whether I failed or not? Who was I that I should not fail,
like my betters? It would do me good to fail. He wanted to see me
worsted (I knew he did), and one minute he paused to take
breath.</p>
<p id="id02602">"Would I speak now, and be tractable?"</p>
<p id="id02603">"Never would I be tractable in this matter. Law
itself should not compel me. I would pay a fine, or undergo an
imprisonment, rather than write for a show and to order, perched up
on a platform."</p>
<p id="id02604">"Could softer motives influence me? Would I yield
for friendship's sake?"</p>
<p id="id02605">"Not a whit, not a hair-breadth. No form of
friendship under the sun had a right to exact such a concession. No
true friendship would harass me thus."</p>
<p id="id02606">He supposed then (with a
sneer&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;M. Paul could sneer supremely, curling his
lip, opening his nostrils, contracting his
eyelids)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he supposed there was but one form of
appeal to which I would listen, and of that form it was not for him
to make use.</p>
<p id="id02607">"Under certain persuasions, from certain quarters,
je vous vois d'ici," said he, "eagerly subscribing to the
sacrifice, passionately arming for the effort."</p>
<p id="id02608">"Making a simpleton, a warning, and an example of
myself, before a hundred and fifty of the 'papas' and 'mammas' of
Villette."</p>
<p id="id02609">And here, losing patience, I broke out afresh with
a cry that I wanted to be liberated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to get out
into the air&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I was almost in a fever.</p>
<p id="id02610">"Chut!" said the inexorable, "this was a mere
pretext to run away; <i>he</i> was not hot, with the stove close at
his back; how could I suffer, thoroughly screened by his
person?"</p>
<p id="id02611">"I did not understand his constitution. I knew
nothing of the natural history of salamanders. For my own part, I
was a phlegmatic islander, and sitting in an oven did not agree
with me; at least, might I step to the well, and get a glass of
water&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the sweet apples had made me thirsty?"</p>
<p id="id02612">"If that was all, he would do my errand."</p>
<p id="id02613">He went to fetch the water. Of course, with a door
only on the latch behind me, I lost not my opportunity. Ere his
return, his half-worried prey had escaped.</p>
<h2 id="id02614" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h5 id="id02615">THE DRYAD.</h5>
<p id="id02616" style="margin-top: 2em">The spring was advancing,
and the weather had turned suddenly warm. This change of
temperature brought with it for me, as probably for many others,
temporary decrease of strength. Slight exertion at this time left
me overcome with fatigue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sleepless nights
entailed languid days.</p>
<p id="id02617">One Sunday afternoon, having walked the distance of
half a league to the Protestant church, I came back weary and
exhausted; and taking refuge in my solitary sanctuary, the first
classe, I was glad to sit down, and to make of my desk a pillow for
my arms and head.</p>
<p id="id02618">Awhile I listened to the lullaby of bees humming in
the berceau, and watched, through the glass door and the tender,
lightly-strewn spring foliage, Madame Beck and a gay party of
friends, whom she had entertained that day at dinner after morning
mass, walking in the centre-alley under orchard boughs dressed at
this season in blossom, and wearing a colouring as pure and warm as
mountain-snow at sun-rise.</p>
<p id="id02619">My principal attraction towards this group of
guests lay, I remember, in one figure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that of a
handsome young girl whom I had seen before as a visitor at Madame
Beck's, and of whom I had been vaguely told that she was a
"filleule," or god-daughter, of M. Emanuel's, and that between her
mother, or aunt, or some other female relation of hers, and the
Professor, had existed of old a special friendship. M. Paul was not
of the holiday band to-day, but I had seen this young girl with him
ere now, and as far as distant observation could enable me to
judge, she seemed to enjoy him with the frank ease of a ward with
an indulgent guardian. I had seen her run up to him, put her arm
through his, and hang upon him. Once, when she did so, a curious
sensation had struck through me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a disagreeable
anticipatory sensation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one of the family of
presentiments, I suppose&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but I refused to
analyze or dwell upon it. While watching this girl, Mademoiselle
Sauveur by name, and following the gleam of her bright silk robe
(she was always richly dressed, for she was said to be wealthy)
through the flowers and the glancing leaves of tender emerald, my
eyes became dazzled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;they closed; my lassitude,
the warmth of the day, the hum of bees and birds, all lulled me,
and at last I slept.</p>
<p id="id02620">Two hours stole over me. Ere I woke, the sun had
declined out of sight behind the towering houses, the garden and
the room were grey, bees had gone homeward, and the flowers were
closing; the party of guests, too, had vanished; each alley was
void.</p>
<p id="id02621">On waking, I felt much at
ease&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not chill, as I ought to have been after
sitting so still for at least two hours; my cheek and arms were not
benumbed by pressure against the hard desk. No wonder. Instead of
the bare wood on which I had laid them, I found a thick shawl,
carefully folded, substituted for support, and another shawl (both
taken from the corridor where such things hung) wrapped warmly
round me.</p>
<p id="id02622">Who had done this? Who was my friend? Which of the
teachers? Which of the pupils? None, except St. Pierre, was
inimical to me; but which of them had the art, the thought, the
habit, of benefiting thus tenderly? Which of them had a step so
quiet, a hand so gentle, but I should have heard or felt her, if
she had approached or touched me in a day-sleep?</p>
<p id="id02623">As to Ginevra Fanshawe, that bright young creature
was not gentle at all, and would certainly have pulled me out of my
chair, if she had meddled in the matter. I said at last: "It is
Madame Beck's doing; she has come in, seen me asleep, and thought I
might take cold. She considers me a useful machine, answering well
the purpose for which it was hired; so would not have me needlessly
injured. And now," methought, "I'll take a walk; the evening is
fresh, and not very chill."</p>
<p id="id02624">So I opened the glass door and stepped into the
berceau.</p>
<p id="id02625">I went to my own alley: had it been dark, or even
dusk, I should have hardly ventured there, for I had not yet
forgotten the curious illusion of vision (if illusion it were)
experienced in that place some months ago. But a ray of the setting
sun burnished still the grey crown of Jean Baptiste; nor had all
the birds of the garden yet vanished into their nests amongst the
tufted shrubs and thick wall-ivy. I paced up and down, thinking
almost the same thoughts I had pondered that night when I buried my
glass jar&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how I should make some advance in
life, take another step towards an independent position; for this
train of reflection, though not lately pursued, had never by me
been wholly abandoned; and whenever a certain eye was averted from
me, and a certain countenance grew dark with unkindness and
injustice, into that track of speculation did I at once strike; so
that, little by little, I had laid half a plan.</p>
<p id="id02626">"Living costs little," said I to myself, "in this
economical town of Villette, where people are more sensible than I
understand they are in dear old
England&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;infinitely less worried about
appearance, and less emulous of display&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where
nobody is in the least ashamed to be quite as homely and saving as
he finds convenient. House-rent, in a prudently chosen situation,
need not be high. When I shall have saved one thousand francs, I
will take a tenement with one large room, and two or three smaller
ones, furnish the first with a few benches and desks, a black
tableau, an estrade for myself; upon it a chair and table, with a
sponge and some white chalks; begin with taking day-pupils, and so
work my way upwards. Madame Beck's commencement
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as I have often heard her
say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;from no higher starting-point, and where is
she now? All these premises and this garden are hers, bought with
her money; she has a competency already secured for old age, and a
flourishing establishment under her direction, which will furnish a
career for her children.</p>
<p id="id02627">"Courage, Lucy Snowe! With self-denial and economy
now, and steady exertion by-and-by, an object in life need not fail
you. Venture not to complain that such an object is too selfish,
too limited, and lacks interest; be content to labour for
independence until you have proved, by winning that prize, your
right to look higher. But afterwards, is there nothing more for me
in life&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no true home&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing
to be dearer to me than myself, and by its paramount preciousness,
to draw from me better things than I care to culture for myself
only? Nothing, at whose feet I can willingly lay down the whole
burden of human egotism, and gloriously take up the nobler charge
of labouring and living for others? I suppose, Lucy Snowe, the orb
of your life is not to be so rounded: for you, the crescent-phase
must suffice. Very good. I see a huge mass of my fellow-creatures
in no better circumstances. I see that a great many men, and more
women, hold their span of life on conditions of denial and
privation. I find no reason why I should be of the few favoured. I
believe in some blending of hope and sunshine sweetening the worst
lots. I believe that this life is not all; neither the beginning
nor the end. I believe while I tremble; I trust while I weep."</p>
<p id="id02628">So this subject is done with. It is right to look
our life-accounts bravely in the face now and then, and settle them
honestly. And he is a poor self-swindler who lies to himself while
he reckons the items, and sets down under the
head&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;happiness that which is misery. Call
anguish&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;anguish, and
despair&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;despair; write both down in strong
characters with a resolute pen: you will the better pay your debt
to Doom. Falsify: insert "privilege" where you should have written
"pain;" and see if your mighty creditor will allow the fraud to
pass, or accept the coin with which you would cheat him. Offer to
the strongest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if the darkest angel of God's
host&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;water, when he has asked
blood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will he take it? Not a whole pale sea for
one red drop. I settled another account.</p>
<p id="id02629">Pausing before Methusaleh&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
giant and patriarch of the garden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and leaning my
brow against his knotty trunk, my foot rested on the stone sealing
the small sepulchre at his root; and I recalled the passage of
feeling therein buried; I recalled Dr. John; my warm affection for
him; my faith in his excellence; my delight in his grace. What was
become of that curious one-sided friendship which was half marble
and half life; only on one hand truth, and on the other perhaps a
jest?</p>
<p id="id02630">Was this feeling dead? I do not know, but it was
buried. Sometimes I thought the tomb unquiet, and dreamed strangely
of disturbed earth, and of hair, still golden, and living, obtruded
through coffin-chinks.</p>
<p id="id02631">Had I been too hasty? I used to ask myself; and
this question would occur with a cruel sharpness after some brief
chance interview with Dr. John. He had still such kind looks, such
a warm hand; his voice still kept so pleasant a tone for my name; I
never liked "Lucy" so well as when he uttered it. But I learned in
time that this benignity, this cordiality, this music, belonged in
no shape to me: it was a part of himself; it was the honey of his
temper; it was the balm of his mellow mood; he imparted it, as the
ripe fruit rewards with sweetness the rifling bee; he diffused it
about him, as sweet plants shed their perfume. Does the nectarine
love either the bee or bird it feeds? Is the sweetbriar enamoured
of the air?</p>
<p id="id02632">"Good-night, Dr. John; you are good, you are
beautiful; but you are not mine. Good-night, and God bless
you!"</p>
<p id="id02633">Thus I closed my musings. "Good-night" left my lips
in sound; I heard the words spoken, and then I heard an
echo&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quite close.</p>
<p id="id02634">"Good-night, Mademoiselle; or, rather,
good-evening&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the sun is scarce set; I hope you
slept well?"</p>
<p id="id02635">I started, but was only discomposed a moment; I
knew the voice and speaker.</p>
<p id="id02636">"Slept, Monsieur! When? where?"</p>
<p id="id02637">"You may well inquire
when&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where. It seems you turn day into night,
and choose a desk for a pillow; rather hard
lodging&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id02638">"It was softened for me, Monsieur, while I slept.
That unseen, gift-bringing thing which haunts my desk, remembered
me. No matter how I fell asleep; I awoke pillowed and covered."</p>
<p id="id02639">"Did the shawls keep you warm?"</p>
<p id="id02640">"Very warm. Do you ask thanks for them?"</p>
<p id="id02641">"No. You looked pale in your slumbers: are you
home-sick?"</p>
<p id="id02642">"To be home-sick, one must have a home; which I
have not."</p>
<p id="id02643">"Then you have more need of a careful friend. I
scarcely know any one, Miss Lucy, who needs a friend more
absolutely than you; your very faults imperatively require it. You
want so much checking, regulating, and keeping down."</p>
<p id="id02644">This idea of "keeping down" never left M. Paul's
head; the most habitual subjugation would, in my case, have failed
to relieve him of it. No matter; what did it signify? I listened to
him, and did not trouble myself to be too submissive; his
occupation would have been gone had I left him nothing to "keep
down."</p>
<p id="id02645">"You need watching, and watching over," he pursued;
"and it is well for you that I see this, and do my best to
discharge both duties. I watch you and others pretty closely,
pretty constantly, nearer and oftener than you or they think. Do
you see that window with a light in it?"</p>
<p id="id02646">He pointed to a lattice in one of the college
boarding-houses.</p>
<p id="id02647">"That," said he, "is a room I have hired, nominally
for a study&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;virtually for a post of observation.
There I sit and read for hours together: it is my
way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my taste. My book is this garden; its
contents are human nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;female human nature. I
know you all by heart. Ah! I know you well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;St.
Pierre, the Parisienne&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;cette
ma&Atilde;&reg;tresse-femme, my cousin Beck herself."</p>
<p id="id02648">"It is not right, Monsieur."</p>
<p id="id02649">"Comment? it is not right? By whose creed? Does
some dogma of Calvin or Luther condemn it? What is that to me? I am
no Protestant. My rich father (for, though I have known poverty,
and once starved for a year in a garret in
Rome&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;starved wretchedly, often on a meal a day,
and sometimes not that&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;yet I was born to
wealth)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my rich father was a good Catholic; and
he gave me a priest and a Jesuit for a tutor. I retain his lessons;
and to what discoveries, grand Dieu! have they not aided me!"</p>
<p id="id02650">"Discoveries made by stealth seem to me
dishonourable discoveries."</p>
<p id="id02651">"Puritaine! I doubt it not. Yet see how my Jesuit's
system works. You know the St. Pierre?"</p>
<p id="id02652">"Partially."</p>
<p id="id02653">He laughed. "You say
right&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>'partially'</i>; whereas <i>I</i> know
her <i>thoroughly</i>; there is the difference. She played before
me the amiable; offered me patte de velours; caressed, flattered,
fawned on me. Now, I am accessible to a woman's
flattery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;accessible against my reason. Though
never pretty, she was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when I first knew
her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;young, or knew how to look young. Like all
her countrywomen, she had the art of
dressing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she had a certain cool, easy, social
assurance, which spared me the pain of
embarrassment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02654">"Monsieur, that must have been unnecessary. I never
saw you embarrassed in my life."</p>
<p id="id02655">"Mademoiselle, you know little of me; I can be
embarrassed as a petite pensionnaire; there is a fund of modesty
and diffidence in my nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02656">"Monsieur, I never saw it."</p>
<p id="id02657">"Mademoiselle, it is there. You ought to have seen
it."</p>
<p id="id02658">"Monsieur, I have observed you in
public&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on platforms, in tribunes, before titles
and crowned heads&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and you were as easy as you
are in the third division."</p>
<p id="id02659">"Mademoiselle, neither titles nor crowned heads
excite my modesty; and publicity is very much my element. I like it
well, and breathe in it quite
freely;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but, in short,
here is the sentiment brought into action, at this very moment;
however, I disdain to be worsted by it. If, Mademoiselle, I were a
marrying man (which I am not; and you may spare yourself the
trouble of any sneer you may be contemplating at the thought), and
found it necessary to ask a lady whether she could look upon me in
the light of a future husband, then would it be proved that I am as
I say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;modest."</p>
<p id="id02660">I quite believed him now; and, in believing, I
honoured him with a sincerity of esteem which made my heart
ache.</p>
<p id="id02661">"As to the St. Pierre," he went on, recovering
himself, for his voice had altered a little, "she once intended to
be Madame Emanuel; and I don't know whither I might have been led,
but for yonder little lattice with the light. Ah, magic lattice!
what miracles of discovery hast thou wrought! Yes," he pursued, "I
have seen her rancours, her vanities, her
levities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not only here, but elsewhere: I have
witnessed what bucklers me against all her arts: I am safe from
poor Z&Atilde;&copy;lie."</p>
<p id="id02662">"And my pupils," he presently recommenced, "those
blondes jeunes filles&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so mild and
meek&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I have seen the most
reserved&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;romp like boys, the
demurest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;snatch grapes from the walls, shake
pears from the trees. When the English teacher came, I saw her,
marked her early preference for this alley, noticed her taste for
seclusion, watched her well, long before she and I came to speaking
terms; do you recollect my once coming silently and offering you a
little knot of white violets when we were strangers?"</p>
<p id="id02663">"I recollect it. I dried the violets, kept them,
and have them still."</p>
<p id="id02664">"It pleased me when you took them peacefully and
promptly, without prudery&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that sentiment which I
ever dread to excite, and which, when it is revealed in eye or
gesture, I vindictively detest. To return. Not only did <i>I</i>
watch you; but often&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;especially at
eventide&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;another guardian angel was noiselessly
hovering near: night after night my cousin Beck has stolen down
yonder steps, and glidingly pursued your movements when you did not
see her."</p>
<p id="id02665">"But, Monsieur, you could not from the distance of
that window see what passed in this garden at night?"</p>
<p id="id02666">"By moonlight I possibly might with a
glass&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I use a glass&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but the
garden itself is open to me. In the shed, at the bottom, there is a
door leading into a court, which communicates with the college; of
that door I possess the key, and thus come and go at pleasure. This
afternoon I came through it, and found you asleep in classe; again
this evening I have availed myself of the same entrance."</p>
<p id="id02667">I could not help saying, "If you were a wicked,
designing man, how terrible would all this be!"</p>
<p id="id02668">His attention seemed incapable of being arrested by
this view of the subject: he lit his cigar, and while he puffed it,
leaning against a tree, and looking at me in a cool, amused way he
had when his humour was tranquil, I thought proper to go on
sermonizing him: he often lectured me by the hour
together&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I did not see why I should not speak my
mind for once. So I told him my impressions concerning his
Jesuit-system.</p>
<p id="id02669">"The knowledge it brings you is bought too dear,
Monsieur; this coming and going by stealth degrades your own
dignity."</p>
<p id="id02670">"My dignity!" he cried, laughing; "when did you
ever see me trouble my head about my dignity? It is you, Miss Lucy,
who are 'digne.' How often, in your high insular presence, have I
taken a pleasure in trampling upon, what you are pleased to call,
my dignity; tearing it, scattering it to the winds, in those mad
transports you witness with such hauteur, and which I know you
think very like the ravings of a third-rate London actor."</p>
<p id="id02671">"Monsieur, I tell you every glance you cast from
that lattice is a wrong done to the best part of your own nature.
To study the human heart thus, is to banquet secretly and
sacrilegiously on Eve's apples. I wish you were a Protestant."</p>
<p id="id02672">Indifferent to the wish, he smoked on. After a
space of smiling yet thoughtful silence, he said, rather
suddenly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I have seen other things."</p>
<p id="id02673">"What other things?"</p>
<p id="id02674">Taking the weed from his lips, he threw the remnant
amongst the shrubs, where, for a moment, it lay glowing in the
gloom.</p>
<p id="id02675">"Look, at it," said he: "is not that spark like an
eye watching you and me?"</p>
<p id="id02676">He took a turn down the walk; presently returning,
he went on:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I have seen, Miss Lucy, things to
me unaccountable, that have made me watch all night for a solution,
and I have not yet found it."</p>
<p id="id02677">The tone was peculiar; my veins thrilled; he saw me
shiver.</p>
<p id="id02678">"Are you afraid? Whether is it of my words or that
red jealous eye just winking itself out?"</p>
<p id="id02679">"I am cold; the night grows dark and late, and the
air is changed; it is time to go in."</p>
<p id="id02680">"It is little past eight, but you shall go in soon.
Answer me only this question."</p>
<p id="id02681">Yet he paused ere he put it. The garden was truly
growing dark; dusk had come on with clouds, and drops of rain began
to patter through the trees. I hoped he would feel this, but, for
the moment, he seemed too much absorbed to be sensible of the
change.</p>
<p id="id02682">"Mademoiselle, do you Protestants believe in the
supernatural?"</p>
<p id="id02683">"There is a difference of theory and belief on this
point amongst Protestants as amongst other sects," I answered.
"Why, Monsieur, do you ask such a question?"</p>
<p id="id02684">"Why do you shrink and speak so faintly? Are you
superstitious?"</p>
<p id="id02685">"I am constitutionally nervous. I dislike the
discussion of such subjects. I dislike it the more
because&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02686">"You believe?"</p>
<p id="id02687">"No: but it has happened to me to experience
impressions&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02688">"Since you came here?"</p>
<p id="id02689">"Yes; not many months ago."</p>
<p id="id02690">"Here?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in this house?"</p>
<p id="id02691">"Yes."</p>
<p id="id02692">"Bon! I am glad of it. I knew it, somehow; before
you told me. I was conscious of rapport between you and myself. You
are patient, and I am choleric; you are quiet and pale, and I am
tanned and fiery; you are a strict Protestant, and I am a sort of
lay Jesuit: but we are alike&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there is affinity
between us. Do you see it, Mademoiselle, when you look in the
glass? Do you observe that your forehead is shaped like
mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that your eyes are cut like mine? Do you
hear that you have some of my tones of voice? Do you know that you
have many of my looks? I perceive all this, and believe that you
were born under my star. Yes, you were born under my star! Tremble!
for where that is the case with mortals, the threads of their
destinies are difficult to disentangle; knottings and catchings
occur&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sudden breaks leave damage in the web. But
these 'impressions,' as you say, with English caution. I, too, have
had my 'impressions.'"</p>
<p id="id02693">"Monsieur, tell me them."</p>
<p id="id02694">"I desire no better, and intend no less. You know
the legend of this house and garden?"</p>
<p id="id02695">"I know it. Yes. They say that hundreds of years
ago a nun was buried here alive at the foot of this very tree,
beneath the ground which now bears us."</p>
<p id="id02696">"And that in former days a nun's ghost used to come
and go here."</p>
<p id="id02697">"Monsieur, what if it comes and goes here
still?"</p>
<p id="id02698">"Something comes and goes here: there is a shape
frequenting this house by night, different to any forms that show
themselves by day. I have indisputably seen a something, more than
once; and to me its conventual weeds were a strange sight, saying
more than they can do to any other living being. A nun!"</p>
<p id="id02699">"Monsieur, I, too, have seen it."</p>
<p id="id02700">"I anticipated that. Whether this nun be flesh and
blood, or something that remains when blood is dried, and flesh is
wasted, her business is as much with you as with me, probably.
Well, I mean to make it out; it has baffled me so far, but I mean
to follow up the mystery. I mean&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02701">Instead of telling what he meant, he raised his
head suddenly; I made the same movement in the same instant; we
both looked to one point&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the high tree shadowing
the great berceau, and resting some of its boughs on the roof of
the first classe. There had been a strange and inexplicable sound
from that quarter, as if the arms of that tree had swayed of their
own motion, and its weight of foliage had rushed and crushed
against the massive trunk. Yes; there scarce stirred a breeze, and
that heavy tree was convulsed, whilst the feathery shrubs stood
still. For some minutes amongst the wood and leafage a rending and
heaving went on. Dark as it was, it seemed to me that something
more solid than either night-shadow, or branch-shadow, blackened
out of the boles. At last the struggle ceased. What birth succeeded
this travail? What Dryad was born of these throes? We watched
fixedly. A sudden bell rang in the house&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
prayer-bell. Instantly into our alley there came, out of the
berceau, an apparition, all black and white. With a sort of angry
rush-close, close past our faces&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;swept swiftly
the very NUN herself! Never had I seen her so clearly. She looked
tall of stature, and fierce of gesture. As she went, the wind rose
sobbing; the rain poured wild and cold; the whole night seemed to
feel her.</p>
<h2 id="id02702" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h5 id="id02703">THE FIRST LETTER.</h5>
<p id="id02704" style="margin-top: 2em">Where, it becomes time to
inquire, was Paulina Mary? How fared my intercourse with the
sumptuous H&Atilde;&acute;tel Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy? That intercourse
had, for an interval, been suspended by absence; M. and Miss de
Bassompierre had been travelling, dividing some weeks between the
provinces and capital of France. Chance apprised me of their return
very shortly after it took place.</p>
<p id="id02705">I was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet
boulevard, wandering slowly on, enjoying the benign April sun, and
some thoughts not unpleasing, when I saw before me a group of
riders, stopping as if they had just encountered, and exchanging
greetings in the midst of the broad, smooth, linden-bordered path;
on one side a middle-aged gentleman and young lady, on the
other&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a young and handsome man. Very graceful
was the lady's mien, choice her appointments, delicate and stately
her whole aspect. Still, as I looked, I felt they were known to me,
and, drawing a little nearer, I fully recognised them all: the
Count Home de Bassompierre, his daughter, and Dr. Graham
Bretton.</p>
<p id="id02706">How animated was Graham's face! How true, how warm,
yet how retiring the joy it expressed! This was the state of
things, this the combination of circumstances, at once to attract
and enchain, to subdue and excite Dr. John. The pearl he admired
was in itself of great price and truest purity, but he was not the
man who, in appreciating the gem, could forget its setting. Had he
seen Paulina with the same youth, beauty, and grace, but on foot,
alone, unguarded, and in simple attire, a dependent worker, a
demi-grisette, he would have thought her a pretty little creature,
and would have loved with his eye her movements and her mien, but
it required other than this to conquer him as he was now
vanquished, to bring him safe under dominion as now, without loss,
and even with gain to his manly honour, one saw that he was
reduced; there was about Dr. John all the man of the world; to
satisfy himself did not suffice; society must
approve&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the world must admire what he did, or he
counted his measures false and futile. In his victrix he required
all that was here visible&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the imprint of high
cultivation, the consecration of a careful and authoritative
protection, the adjuncts that Fashion decrees, Wealth purchases,
and Taste adjusts; for these conditions his spirit stipulated ere
it surrendered: they were here to the utmost fulfilled; and now,
proud, impassioned, yet fearing, he did homage to Paulina as his
sovereign. As for her, the smile of feeling, rather than of
conscious power, slept soft in her eyes.</p>
<p id="id02707">They parted. He passed me at speed, hardly feeling
the earth he skimmed, and seeing nothing on either hand. He looked
very handsome; mettle and purpose were roused in him fully.</p>
<p id="id02708">"Papa, there is Lucy!" cried a musical, friendly
voice. "Lucy, dear<br />
Lucy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>do</i> come here!"<br /></p>
<p id="id02709">I hastened to her. She threw back her veil, and
stooped from her saddle to kiss me.</p>
<p id="id02710">"I was coming to see you to-morrow," said she; "but
now to-morrow you will come and see me."</p>
<p id="id02711">She named the hour, and I promised compliance.</p>
<p id="id02712">The morrow's evening found me with
her&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she and I shut into her own room. I had not
seen her since that occasion when her claims were brought into
comparison with those of Ginevra Fanshawe, and had so signally
prevailed; she had much to tell me of her travels in the interval.
A most animated, rapid speaker was she in such a
t&Atilde;&ordf;te-&Atilde;&nbsp;-t&Atilde;&ordf;te, a most lively
describer; yet with her artless diction and clear soft voice, she
never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much. My own attention
I think would not soon have flagged, but by-and-by, she herself
seemed to need some change of subject; she hastened to wind up her
narrative briefly. Yet why she terminated with so concise an
abridgment did not immediately appear; silence
followed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a restless silence, not without
symptoms of abstraction. Then, turning to me, in a diffident,
half-appealing
voice&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Lucy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id02713">"Well, I am at your side."</p>
<p id="id02714">"Is my cousin Ginevra still at Madame Beck's?"</p>
<p id="id02715">"Your cousin is still there; you must be longing to
see her."</p>
<p id="id02716">"No&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not much."</p>
<p id="id02717">"You want to invite her to spend another
evening?"</p>
<p id="id02718">"No&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; I suppose she still talks
about being married?"</p>
<p id="id02719">"Not to any one you care for."</p>
<p id="id02720">"But of course she still thinks of Dr. Bretton? She
cannot have changed her mind on that point, because it was so fixed
two months ago."</p>
<p id="id02721">"Why, you know, it does not matter. You saw the
terms on which they stood."</p>
<p id="id02722">"There was a little misunderstanding that evening,
certainly; does she seem unhappy?"</p>
<p id="id02723">"Not she. To change the subject. Have you heard or
seen nothing of, or from. Graham during your absence?"</p>
<p id="id02724">"Papa had letters from him once or twice about
business, I think. He undertook the management of some affair which
required attention while we were away. Dr. Bretton seems to respect
papa, and to have pleasure in obliging him."</p>
<p id="id02725">"Yes: you met him yesterday on the boulevard; you
would be able to judge from his aspect that his friends need not be
painfully anxious about his health?"</p>
<p id="id02726">"Papa seems to have thought with you. I could not
help smiling. He is not particularly observant, you know, because
he is often thinking of other things than what pass before his
eyes; but he said, as Dr. Bretton rode away, `Really it does a man
good to see the spirit and energy of that boy.' He called Dr.
Bretton a boy; I believe he almost thinks him so, just as he thinks
me a little girl; he was not speaking to me, but dropped that
remark to himself. Lucy&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."</p>
<p id="id02727">Again fell the appealing accent, and at the same
instant she left her chair, and came and sat on the stool at my
feet.</p>
<p id="id02728">I liked her. It is not a declaration I have often
made concerning my acquaintance, in the course of this book: the
reader will bear with it for once. Intimate intercourse, close
inspection, disclosed in Paulina only what was delicate,
intelligent, and sincere; therefore my regard for her lay deep. An
admiration more superficial might have been more demonstrative;
mine, however, was quiet.</p>
<p id="id02729">"What have you to ask of Lucy?" said I; "be brave,
and speak out"</p>
<p id="id02730">But there was no courage in her eye; as it met
mine, it fell; and there was no coolness on her
cheek&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not a transient surface-blush, but a
gathering inward excitement raised its tint and its
temperature.</p>
<p id="id02731">"Lucy, I <i>do</i> wish to know your thoughts of
Dr. Bretton. Do, <i>do</i> give me your real opinion of his
character, his disposition."</p>
<p id="id02732">"His character stands high, and deservedly
high."</p>
<p id="id02733">"And his disposition? Tell me about his
disposition," she urged; "you know him well."</p>
<p id="id02734">"I know him pretty well."</p>
<p id="id02735">"You know his home-side. You have seen him with his
mother; speak of him as a son."</p>
<p id="id02736">"He is a fine-hearted son; his mother's comfort and
hope, her pride and pleasure."</p>
<p id="id02737">She held my hand between hers, and at each
favourable word gave it a little caressing stroke.</p>
<p id="id02738">"In what other way is he good, Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id02739">"Dr. Bretton is
benevolent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;humanely disposed towards all his
race, Dr. Bretton would have benignity for the lowest savage, or
the worst criminal."</p>
<p id="id02740">"I heard some gentlemen, some of papa's friends,
who were talking about him, say the same. They say many of the poor
patients at the hospitals, who tremble before some pitiless and
selfish surgeons, welcome him."</p>
<p id="id02741">"They are right; I have witnessed as much. He once
took me over a hospital; I saw how he was received: your father's
friends are right."</p>
<p id="id02742">The softest gratitude animated her eye as she
lifted it a moment. She had yet more to say, but seemed hesitating
about time and place. Dusk was beginning to reign; her parlour fire
already glowed with twilight ruddiness; but I thought she wished
the room dimmer, the hour later.</p>
<p id="id02743">"How quiet and secluded we feel here!" I remarked,
to reassure her.</p>
<p id="id02744">"Do we? Yes; it is a still evening, and I shall not
be called down to tea; papa is dining out."</p>
<p id="id02745">Still holding my hand, she played with the fingers
unconsciously, dressed them, now in her own rings, and now circled
them with a twine of her beautiful hair; she patted the palm
against her hot cheek, and at last, having cleared a voice that was
naturally liquid as a lark's, she said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02746">"You must think it rather strange that I should
talk so much about Dr.<br />
Bretton, ask so many questions, take such an interest,
but&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;".<br /></p>
<p id="id02747">"Not at all strange; perfectly natural; you like
him."</p>
<p id="id02748">"And if I did," said she, with slight quickness,
"is that a reason why<br />
I should talk? I suppose you think me weak, like my cousin
Ginevra?"<br /></p>
<p id="id02749">"If I thought you one whit like Madame Ginevra, I
would not sit here waiting for your communications. I would get up,
walk at my ease about the room, and anticipate all you had to say
by a round lecture. Go on."</p>
<p id="id02750">"I mean to go on," retorted she; "what else do you
suppose I mean to do?"</p>
<p id="id02751">And she looked and spoke&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
little Polly of Bretton&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;petulant, sensitive.</p>
<p id="id02752">"If," said she, emphatically, "if I liked Dr. John
till I was fit to die for liking him, that alone could not license
me to be otherwise than dumb&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dumb as the
grave&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dumb as you, Lucy
Snowe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you know it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and you
know you would despise me if I failed in self-control, and whined
about some rickety liking that was all on my side."</p>
<p id="id02753">"It is true I little respect women or girls who are
loquacious either in boasting the triumphs, or bemoaning the
mortifications, of feelings. But as to you, Paulina, speak, for I
earnestly wish to hear you. Tell me all it will give you pleasure
or relief to tell: I ask no more."</p>
<p id="id02754">"Do you care for me, Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id02755">"Yes, I do, Paulina."</p>
<p id="id02756">"And I love you. I had an odd content in being with
you even when I was a little, troublesome, disobedient girl; it was
charming to me then to lavish on you my naughtiness and whims. Now
you are acceptable to me, and I like to talk with and trust you. So
listen, Lucy."</p>
<p id="id02757">And she settled herself, resting against my
arm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;resting gently, not with honest Mistress
Fanshawe's fatiguing and selfish weight.</p>
<p id="id02758">"A few minutes since you asked whether we had not
heard from Graham during our absence, and I said there were two
letters for papa on business; this was true, but I did not tell you
all."</p>
<p id="id02759">"You evaded?"</p>
<p id="id02760">"I shuffled and equivocated, you know. However, I
am going to speak the truth now; it is getting darker; one can talk
at one's ease. Papa often lets me open the letter-bag and give him
out the contents. One morning, about three weeks ago, you don't
know how surprised I was to find, amongst a dozen letters for M. de
Bassompierre, a note addressed to Miss de Bassompierre. I spied it
at once, amidst all the rest; the handwriting was not strange; it
attracted me directly. I was going to say, 'Papa, here is another
letter from Dr. Bretton;' but the 'Miss' struck me mute. I actually
never received a letter from a gentleman before. Ought I to have
shown it to papa, and let him open it and read it first? I could
not for my life, Lucy. I know so well papa's ideas about me: he
forgets my age; he thinks I am a mere school-girl; he is not aware
that other people see I am grown up as tall as I shall be; so, with
a curious mixture of feelings, some of them self-reproachful, and
some so fluttering and strong, I cannot describe them, I gave papa
his twelve letters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his herd of
possessions&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and kept back my one, my ewe-lamb.
It lay in my lap during breakfast, looking up at me with an
inexplicable meaning, making me feel myself a thing
double-existent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a child to that dear papa, but
no more a child to myself. After breakfast I carried my letter
up-stairs, and having secured myself by turning the key in the
door, I began to study the outside of my treasure: it was some
minutes before I could get over the direction and penetrate the
seal; one does not take a strong place of this kind by instant
storm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one sits down awhile before it, as
beleaguers say. Graham's hand is like himself, Lucy, and so is his
seal&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all clear, firm, and
rounded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no slovenly splash of
wax&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a full, solid, steady
drop&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a distinct impress; no pointed turns
harshly pricking the optic nerve, but a clean, mellow, pleasant
manuscript, that soothes you as you read. It is like his
face&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;just like the chiselling of his features:
do you know his autograph?"</p>
<p id="id02761">"I have seen it: go on."</p>
<p id="id02762">"The seal was too beautiful to be broken, so I cut
it round with my scissors. On the point of reading the letter at
last, I once more drew back voluntarily; it was too soon yet to
drink that draught&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the sparkle in the cup was so
beautiful&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I would watch it yet a minute. Then I
remembered all at once that I had not said my prayers that morning.
Having heard papa go down to breakfast a little earlier than usual,
I had been afraid of keeping him waiting, and had hastened to join
him as soon as dressed, thinking no harm to put off prayers till
afterwards. Some people would say I ought to have served God first
and then man; but I don't think heaven could be jealous of anything
I might do for papa. I believe I am superstitious. A voice seemed
now to say that another feeling than filial affection was in
question&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to urge me to pray before I dared to
read what I so longed to read&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to deny myself yet
a moment, and remember first a great duty. I have had these
impulses ever since I can remember. I put the letter down and said
my prayers, adding, at the end, a strong entreaty that whatever
happened, I might not be tempted or led to cause papa any sorrow,
and might never, in caring for others, neglect him. The very
thought of such a possibility, so pierced my heart that it made me
cry. But still, Lucy, I felt that in time papa would have to be
taught the truth, managed, and induced to hear reason.</p>
<p id="id02763">"I read the letter. Lucy, life is said to be all
disappointment. <i>I</i> was not disappointed. Ere I read, and
while I read, my heart did more than throb&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it
trembled fast&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;every quiver seemed like the pant
of an animal athirst, laid down at a well and drinking; and the
well proved quite full, gloriously clear; it rose up munificently
of its own impulse; I saw the sun through its gush, and not a mote,
Lucy, no moss, no insect, no atom in the thrice-refined golden
gurgle.</p>
<p id="id02764">"Life," she went on, "is said to be full of pain to
some. I have read biographies where the wayfarer seemed to journey
on from suffering to suffering; where Hope flew before him fast,
never alighting so near, or lingering so long, as to give his hand
a chance of one realizing grasp. I have read of those who sowed in
tears, and whose harvest, so far from being reaped in joy, perished
by untimely blight, or was borne off by sudden whirlwind; and,
alas! some of these met the winter with empty garners, and died of
utter want in the darkest and coldest of the year."</p>
<p id="id02765">"Was it their fault, Paulina, that they of whom you
speak thus died?"</p>
<p id="id02766">"Not always their fault. Some of them were good
endeavouring people. I am not endeavouring, nor actively good, yet
God has caused me to grow in sun, due moisture, and safe
protection, sheltered, fostered, taught, by my dear father; and
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;another comes. Graham
loves me."</p>
<p id="id02767">For some minutes we both paused on this climax.</p>
<p id="id02768">"Does your father know?" I inquired, in a low
voice.</p>
<p id="id02769">"Graham spoke with deep respect of papa, but
implied that he dared not approach that quarter as yet; he must
first prove his worth: he added that he must have some light
respecting myself and my own feelings ere he ventured to risk a
step in the matter elsewhere."</p>
<p id="id02770">"How did you reply?"</p>
<p id="id02771">"I replied briefly, but I did not repulse him. Yet
I almost trembled for fear of making the answer too cordial:
Graham's tastes are so fastidious. I wrote it three
times&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;chastening and subduing the phrases at
every rescript; at last, having confected it till it seemed to me
to resemble a morsel of ice flavoured with ever so slight a zest of
fruit or sugar, I ventured to seal and despatch it."</p>
<p id="id02772">"Excellent, Paulina! Your instinct is fine; you
understand Dr. Bretton."</p>
<p id="id02773">"But how must I manage about papa? There I am still
in pain."</p>
<p id="id02774">"Do not manage at all. Wait now. Only maintain no
further correspondence till your father knows all, and gives his
sanction."</p>
<p id="id02775">"Will he ever give it?"</p>
<p id="id02776">"Time will show. Wait."</p>
<p id="id02777">"Dr. Bretton wrote one other letter, deeply
grateful for my calm, brief note; but I anticipated your advice, by
saying, that while my sentiments continued the same, I could not,
without my fathers knowledge, write again."</p>
<p id="id02778">"You acted as you ought to have done; so Dr.
Bretton will feel: it will increase his pride in you, his love for
you, if either be capable of increase. Paulina, that gentle
hoar-frost of yours, surrounding so much pure, fine flame, is a
priceless privilege of nature."</p>
<p id="id02779">"You see I feel Graham's disposition," said she. "I
feel that no delicacy can be too exquisite for his treatment."</p>
<p id="id02780">"It is perfectly proved that you comprehend him,
and then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whatever Dr. Bretton's disposition,
were he one who expected to be more nearly
met&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you would still act truthfully, openly,
tenderly, with your father."</p>
<p id="id02781">"Lucy, I trust I shall thus act always. Oh, it will
be pain to wake papa from his dream, and tell him I am no more a
little girl!"</p>
<p id="id02782">"Be in no hurry to do so, Paulina. Leave the
revelation to Time and your kind Fate. I also have noticed the
gentleness of her cares for you: doubt not she will benignantly
order the circumstances, and fitly appoint the hour. Yes: I have
thought over your life just as you have yourself thought it over; I
have made comparisons like those to which you adverted. We know not
the future, but the past has been propitious.</p>
<p id="id02783">"As a child I feared for you; nothing that has life
was ever more susceptible than your nature in infancy: under
harshness or neglect, neither your outward nor your inward self
would have ripened to what they now are. Much pain, much fear, much
struggle, would have troubled the very lines of your features,
broken their regularity, would have harassed your nerves into the
fever of habitual irritation you would have lost in health and
cheerfulness, in grace and sweetness. Providence has protected and
cultured you, not only for your own sake, but I believe for
Graham's. His star, too, was fortunate: to develop fully the best
of his nature, a companion like you was needed: there you are,
ready. You must be united. I knew it the first day I saw you
together at La Terrasse. In all that mutually concerns you and
Graham there seems to me promise, plan, harmony. I do not think the
sunny youth of either will prove the forerunner of stormy age. I
think it is deemed good that you two should live in peace and be
happy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not as angels, but as few are happy
amongst mortals. Some lives <i>are</i> thus blessed: it is God's
will: it is the attesting trace and lingering evidence of Eden.
Other lives run from the first another course. Other travellers
encounter weather fitful and gusty, wild and
variable&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;breast adverse winds, are belated and
overtaken by the early closing winter night. Neither can this
happen without the sanction of God; and I know that, amidst His
boundless works, is somewhere stored the secret of this last fate's
justice: I know that His treasures contain the proof as the promise
of its mercy."</p>
<h2 id="id02784" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h5 id="id02785">M. PAUL KEEPS HIS PROMISE.</h5>
<p id="id02786" style="margin-top: 2em">On the first of May, we had
all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;i.e. the twenty boarders and the four
teachers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;notice to rise at five o'clock of the
morning, to be dressed and ready by six, to put ourselves under the
command of M. le Professeur Emanuel, who was to head our march
forth from Villette, for it was on this day he proposed to fulfil
his promise of taking us to breakfast in the country. I, indeed, as
the reader may perhaps remember, had not had the honour of an
invitation when this excursion was first
projected&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;rather the contrary; but on my now
making allusion to this fact, and wishing to know how it was to be,
my ear received a pull, of which I did not venture to challenge the
repetition by raising, further difficulties.</p>
<p id="id02787">"Je vous conseille de vous faire prier," said M.
Emanuel, imperially menacing the other ear. One Napoleonic
compliment, however, was enough, so I made up my mind to be of the
party.</p>
<p id="id02788">The morning broke calm as summer, with singing of
birds in the garden, and a light dew-mist that promised heat. We
all said it would be warm, and we all felt pleasure in folding away
heavy garments, and in assuming the attire suiting a sunny season.
The clean fresh print dress, and the light straw bonnet, each made
and trimmed as the French workwoman alone can make and trim, so as
to unite the utterly unpretending with the perfectly becoming, was
the rule of costume. Nobody flaunted in faded silk; nobody wore a
second-hand best article.</p>
<p id="id02789">At six the bell rang merrily, and we poured down
the staircase, through the carr&Atilde;&copy;, along the corridor,
into the vestibule. There stood our Professor, wearing, not his
savage-looking palet&Atilde;&acute;t and severe bonnet-grec, but a
young-looking belted blouse and cheerful straw hat. He had for us
all the kindest good-morrow, and most of us for him had a
thanksgiving smile. We were marshalled in order and soon
started.</p>
<p id="id02790">The streets were yet quiet, and the boulevards were
fresh and peaceful as fields. I believe we were very happy as we
walked along. This chief of ours had the secret of giving a certain
impetus to happiness when he would; just as, in an opposite mood,
he could give a thrill to fear.</p>
<p id="id02791">He did not lead nor follow us, but walked along the
line, giving a word to every one, talking much to his favourites,
and not wholly neglecting even those he disliked. It was rather my
wish, for a reason I had, to keep slightly aloof from notice, and
being paired with Ginevra Fanshawe, bearing on my arm the dear
pressure of that angel's not unsubstantial
limb&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;(she continued in excellent case, and I can
assure the reader it was no trifling business to bear the burden of
her loveliness; many a time in the course of that warm day I wished
to goodness there had been less of the charming
commodity)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;however, having her, as I said, I
tried to make her useful by interposing her always between myself
and M. Paul, shifting my place, according as I heard him coming up
to the right hand or the left. My private motive for this manoeuvre
might be traced to the circumstance of the new print dress I wore,
being pink in colour&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a fact which, under our
present convoy, made me feel something as I have felt, when, clad
in a shawl with a red border, necessitated to traverse a meadow
where pastured a bull.</p>
<p id="id02792">For awhile, the shifting system, together with some
modifications in the arrangement of a black silk scarf, answered my
purpose; but, by-and-by, he found out, that whether he came to this
side or to that, Miss Fanshawe was still his neighbour. The course
of acquaintance between Ginevra and him had never run so smooth
that his temper did not undergo a certain crisping process whenever
he heard her English accent: nothing in their dispositions fitted;
they jarred if they came in contact; he held her empty and
affected; she deemed him bearish, meddling, repellent.</p>
<p id="id02793">At last, when he had changed his place for about
the sixth time, finding still the same untoward result to the
experiment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he thrust his head forward, settled
his eyes on mine, and demanded with impatience, "Qu'est-ce que
c'est? Vous me jouez des tours?"</p>
<p id="id02794">The words were hardly out of his mouth, however,
ere, with his customary quickness, he seized the root of this
proceeding: in vain I shook out the long fringe, and spread forth
the broad end of my scarf. "A-h-h! c'est la robe rose!" broke from
his lips, affecting me very much like the sudden and irate low of
some lord of the meadow.</p>
<p id="id02795">"It is only cotton," I alleged, hurriedly; "and
cheaper, and washes better than any other colour."</p>
<p id="id02796">"Et Mademoiselle Lucy est coquette comme dix
Parisiennes," he answered. "A-t-on jamais vu une Anglaise pareille.
Regardez plut&Atilde;&acute;t son chapeau, et ses gants, et ses
brodequins!" These articles of dress were just like what my
companions wore; certainly not one whit
smarter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps rather plainer than
most&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but Monsieur had now got hold of his text,
and I began to chafe under the expected sermon. It went off,
however, as mildly as the menace of a storm sometimes passes on a
summer day. I got but one flash of sheet lightning in the shape of
a single bantering smile from his eyes; and then he said,
"Courage!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&Atilde;&nbsp; vrai dire je ne suis
pas f&Atilde;&cent;ch&Atilde;&copy;, peut-&Atilde;&ordf;tre
m&Atilde;&ordf;me suis je content qu'on s'est fait si belle pour ma
petite f&Atilde;&ordf;te."</p>
<p id="id02797">"Mais ma robe n'est pas belle,
Monsieur&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;elle n'est que propre."</p>
<p id="id02798">"J'aime la propret&Atilde;&copy;," said he. In
short, he was not to be dissatisfied; the sun of good humour was to
triumph on this auspicious morning; it consumed scudding clouds ere
they sullied its disk.</p>
<p id="id02799">And now we were in the country, amongst what they
called "les bois et les petits sentiers." These woods and lanes a
month later would offer but a dusty and doubtful seclusion: now,
however, in their May greenness and morning repose, they looked
very pleasant.</p>
<p id="id02800">We reached a certain well, planted round, in the
taste of Labassecour, with an orderly circle of lime-trees: here a
halt was called; on the green swell of ground surrounding this
well, we were ordered to be seated, Monsieur taking his place in
our midst, and suffering us to gather in a knot round him. Those
who liked him more than they feared, came close, and these were
chiefly little ones; those who feared more than they liked, kept
somewhat aloof; those in whom much affection had given, even to
what remained of fear, a pleasurable zest, observed the greatest
distance.</p>
<p id="id02801">He began to tell us a story. Well could he narrate:
in such a diction as children love, and learned men emulate; a
diction simple in its strength, and strong in its simplicity. There
were beautiful touches in that little tale; sweet glimpses of
feeling and hues of description that, while I listened, sunk into
my mind, and since have never faded. He tinted a twilight
scene&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I hold it in memory
still&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such a picture I have never looked on from
artist's pencil.</p>
<p id="id02802">I have said, that, for myself, I had no impromptu
faculty; and perhaps that very deficiency made me marvel the more
at one who possessed it in perfection. M. Emanuel was not a man to
write books; but I have heard him lavish, with careless,
unconscious prodigality, such mental wealth as books seldom boast;
his mind was indeed my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I
entered bliss. Intellectually imperfect as I was, I could read
little; there were few bound and printed volumes that did not weary
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whose perusal did not fag and
blind&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but his tomes of thought were collyrium to
the spirit's eyes; over their contents, inward sight grew clear and
strong. I used to think what a delight it would be for one who
loved him better than he loved himself, to gather and store up
those handfuls of gold-dust, so recklessly flung to heaven's
reckless winds.</p>
<p id="id02803">His story done, he approached the little knoll
where I and Ginevra sat apart. In his usual mode of demanding an
opinion (he had not reticence to wait till it was voluntarily
offered) he asked, "Were you interested?"</p>
<p id="id02804">According to my wonted undemonstrative fashion, I
simply answered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Yes."</p>
<p id="id02805">"Was it good?"</p>
<p id="id02806">"Very good."</p>
<p id="id02807">"Yet I could not write that down," said he.</p>
<p id="id02808">"Why not, Monsieur?"</p>
<p id="id02809">"I hate the mechanical labour; I hate to stoop and
sit still. I could dictate it, though, with pleasure, to an
amanuensis who suited me. Would Mademoiselle Lucy write for me if I
asked her?"</p>
<p id="id02810">"Monsieur would be too quick; he would urge me, and
be angry if my pen did not keep pace with his lips."</p>
<p id="id02811">"Try some day; let us see the monster I can make of
myself under the circumstances. But just now, there is no question
of dictation; I mean to make you useful in another office. Do you
see yonder farm-house?"</p>
<p id="id02812">"Surrounded with trees? Yes.".</p>
<p id="id02813">"There we are to breakfast; and while the good
fermi&Atilde;&uml;re makes the caf&Atilde;&copy; au lait in a
caldron, you and five others, whom I shall select, will spread with
butter half a hundred rolls."</p>
<p id="id02814">Having formed his troop into line once more, he
marched us straight on the farm, which, on seeing our force,
surrendered without capitulation.</p>
<p id="id02815">Clean knives and plates, and fresh butter being
provided, half-a-dozen of us, chosen by our Professor, set to work
under his directions, to prepare for breakfast a huge basket of
rolls, with which the baker had been ordered to provision the farm,
in anticipation of our coming. Coffee and chocolate were already
made hot; cream and new-laid eggs were added to the treat, and M.
Emanuel, always generous, would have given a large order for
"jambon" and "confitures" in addition, but that some of us, who
presumed perhaps upon our influence, insisted that it would be a
most reckless waste of victual. He railed at us for our pains,
terming us "des m&Atilde;&copy;nag&Atilde;&uml;res avares;" but we
let him talk, and managed the economy of the repast our own
way.</p>
<p id="id02816">With what a pleasant countenance he stood on the
farm-kitchen hearth looking on! He was a man whom it made happy to
see others happy; he liked to have movement, animation, abundance
and enjoyment round him. We asked where he would sit. He told us,
we knew well he was our slave, and we his tyrants, and that he
dared not so much as choose a chair without our leave; so we set
him the farmer's great chair at the head of the long table, and put
him into it.</p>
<p id="id02817">Well might we like him, with all his passions and
hurricanes, when he could be so benignant and docile at times, as
he was just now. Indeed, at the worst, it was only his nerves that
were irritable, not his temper that was radically bad; soothe,
comprehend, comfort him, and he was a lamb; he would not harm a
fly. Only to the very stupid, perverse, or unsympathizing, was he
in the slightest degree dangerous.</p>
<p id="id02818">Mindful always of his religion, he made the
youngest of the party say a little prayer before we began
breakfast, crossing himself as devotedly as a woman. I had never
seen him pray before, or make that pious sign; he did it so simply,
with such child-like faith, I could not help smiling pleasurably as
I watched; his eyes met my smile; he just stretched out his kind
hand, saying, "Donnez-moi la main! I see we worship the same God,
in the same spirit, though by different rites."</p>
<p id="id02819">Most of M. Emanuel's brother Professors were
emancipated free-thinkers, infidels, atheists; and many of them men
whose lives would not bear scrutiny; he was more like a knight of
old, religious in his way, and of spotless fame. Innocent
childhood, beautiful youth were safe at his side. He had vivid
passions, keen feelings, but his pure honour and his artless piety
were the strong charm that kept the lions couchant.</p>
<p id="id02820">That breakfast was a merry meal, and the merriment
was not mere vacant clatter: M. Paul originated, led, controlled
and heightened it; his social, lively temper played unfettered and
unclouded; surrounded only by women and children there was nothing
to cross and thwart him; he had his own way, and a pleasant way it
was.</p>
<p id="id02821">The meal over, the party were free to run and play
in the meadows; a few stayed to help the farmer's wife to put away
her earthenware. M. Paul called me from among these to come out and
sit near him under a tree&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whence he could view
the troop gambolling, over a wide pasture&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
read to him whilst he took his cigar. He sat on a rustic bench, and
I at the tree-root. While I read (a
pocket-classic&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a Corneille&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
did not like it, but he did, finding therein beauties I never could
be brought to perceive), he listened with a sweetness of calm the
more impressive from the impetuosity of his general nature; the
deepest happiness filled his blue eye and smoothed his broad
forehead. I, too, was happy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;happy with the
bright day, happier with his presence, happiest with his
kindness.</p>
<p id="id02822">He asked, by-and-by, if I would not rather run to
my companions than sit there? I said, no; I felt content to be
where he was. He asked whether, if I were his sister, I should
always be content to stay with a brother such as he. I said, I
believed I should; and I felt it. Again, he inquired whether, if he
were to leave Villette, and go far away, I should be sorry; and I
dropped Corneille, and made no reply.</p>
<p id="id02823">"Petite soeur," said he; "how long could you
remember me if we were separated?"</p>
<p id="id02824">"That, Monsieur, I can never tell, because I do not
know how long it will be before I shall cease to remember
everything earthly."</p>
<p id="id02825">"If I were to go beyond seas for
two&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;three&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;five years, should
you welcome me on my return?"</p>
<p id="id02826">"Monsieur, how could I live in the interval?"</p>
<p id="id02827">"Pourtant j'ai &Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; pour
vous bien dur, bien exigeant."</p>
<p id="id02828">I hid my face with the book, for it was covered
with tears. I asked him why he talked so; and he said he would talk
so no more, and cheered me again with the kindest encouragement.
Still, the gentleness with which he treated me during the rest of
the day, went somehow to my heart. It was too tender. It was
mournful. I would rather he had been abrupt, whimsical, and irate
as was his wont.</p>
<p id="id02829">When hot noon arrived&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for the
day turned out as we had anticipated, glowing as
June&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;our shepherd collected his sheep from the
pasture, and proceeded to lead us all softly home. But we had a
whole league to walk, thus far from Villette was the farm where he
had breakfasted; the children, especially, were tired with their
play; the spirits of most flagged at the prospect of this mid-day
walk over chauss&Atilde;&copy;es flinty, glaring, and dusty. This
state of things had been foreseen and provided for. Just beyond the
boundary of the farm we met two spacious vehicles coming to fetch
us&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such conveyances as are hired out purposely
for the accommodation of school-parties; here, with good
management, room was found for all, and in another hour M. Paul
made safe consignment of his charge at the Rue Fossette. It had
been a pleasant day: it would have been perfect, but for the
breathing of melancholy which had dimmed its sunshine a moment.</p>
<p id="id02830">That tarnish was renewed the same evening.</p>
<p id="id02831">Just about sunset, I saw M. Emanuel come out of the
front-door, accompanied by Madame Beck. They paced the centre-alley
for nearly an hour, talking earnestly:
he&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;looking grave, yet restless;
she&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;wearing an amazed, expostulatory, dissuasive
air.</p>
<p id="id02832">I wondered what was under discussion; and when
Madame Beck re-entered the house as it darkened, leaving her
kinsman Paul yet lingering in the garden, I said to
myself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"He called me 'petite soeur' this
morning. If he were really my brother, how I should like to go to
him just now, and ask what it is that presses on his mind. See how
he leans against that tree, with his arms crossed and his brow
bent. He wants consolation, I know: Madame does not console: she
only remonstrates. What
now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id02833">Starting from quiescence to action, M. Paul came
striding erect and quick down the garden. The carr&Atilde;&copy;
doors were yet open: I thought he was probably going to water the
orange-trees in the tubs, after his occasional custom; on reaching
the court, however, he took an abrupt turn and made for the berceau
and the first-classe glass door. There, in that first classe I was,
thence I had been watching him; but there I could not find courage
to await his approach. He had turned so suddenly, he strode so
fast, he looked so strange; the coward within me grew pale, shrank
and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not waiting to listen to reason, and hearing
the shrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his
advance&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she was gone on the wings of panic.</p>
<p id="id02834">Nor did I pause till I had taken sanctuary in the
oratory, now empty. Listening there with beating pulses, and an
unaccountable, undefined apprehension, I heard him pass through all
the schoolrooms, clashing the doors impatiently as he went; I heard
him invade the refectory which the "lecture pieuse" was now holding
under hallowed constraint; I heard him pronounce these
words&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"O&Atilde;&sup1; est Mademoiselle
Lucie?"</p>
<p id="id02835">And just as, summoning my courage, I was preparing
to go down and do what, after all, I most wished to do in the
world&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;viz., meet him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the wiry
voice of St. Pierre replied glibly and falsely, "Elle est au lit."
And he passed, with the stamp of vexation, into the corridor. There
Madame Beck met, captured, chid, convoyed to the street-door, and
finally dismissed him.</p>
<p id="id02836">As that street-door closed, a sudden amazement at
my own perverse proceeding struck like a blow upon me. I felt from
the first it was me he wanted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;me he was
seeking&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and had not I wanted him too? What,
then, had carried me away? What had rapt me beyond his reach? He
had something to tell: he was going to tell me that something: my
ear strained its nerve to hear it, and I had made the confidence
impossible. Yearning to listen and console, while I thought
audience and solace beyond hope's reach&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no
sooner did opportunity suddenly and fully arrive, than I evaded it
as I would have evaded the levelled shaft of mortality.</p>
<p id="id02837">Well, my insane inconsistency had its reward.
Instead of the comfort, the certain satisfaction, I might have
won&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;could I but have put choking panic down, and
stood firm two minutes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;here was dead blank, dark
doubt, and drear suspense.</p>
<p id="id02838">I took my wages to my pillow, and passed the night
counting them.</p>
<h2 id="id02839" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h5 id="id02840">MALEVOLA.</h5>
<p id="id02841" style="margin-top: 2em">Madame Beck called me on
Thursday afternoon, and asked whether I had any occupation to
hinder me from going into town and executing some little
commissions for her at the shops.</p>
<p id="id02842">Being disengaged, and placing myself at her
service, I was presently furnished with a list of the wools, silks,
embroidering thread, etcetera, wanted in the pupils' work, and
having equipped myself in a manner suiting the threatening aspect
of a cloudy and sultry day, I was just drawing the spring-bolt of
the street-door, in act to issue forth, when Madame's voice again
summoned me to the salle-&Atilde;&nbsp;-manger.</p>
<p id="id02843">"Pardon, Meess Lucie!" cried she, in the seeming
haste of an impromptu thought, "I have just recollected one more
errand for you, if your good-nature will not deem itself
over-burdened?"</p>
<p id="id02844">Of course I "confounded myself" in asseverations to
the contrary; and Madame, running into the little salon, brought
thence a pretty basket, filled with fine hothouse fruit, rosy,
perfect, and tempting, reposing amongst the dark green, wax-like
leaves, and pale yellow stars of, I know not what, exotic
plant.</p>
<p id="id02845">"There," she said, "it is not heavy, and will not
shame your neat toilette, as if it were a household, servant-like
detail. Do me the favour to leave this little basket at the house
of Madame Walravens, with my felicitations on her
f&Atilde;&ordf;te. She lives down in the old town,
Num&Atilde;&copy;ro 3, Rue des Mages. I fear you will find the walk
rather long, but you have the whole afternoon before you, and do
not hurry; if you are not back in time for dinner, I will order a
portion to be saved, or Goton, with whom you are a favourite, will
have pleasure in tossing up some trifle, for your especial benefit.
You shall not be forgotten, ma bonne Meess. And oh! please!"
(calling me back once more) "be sure to insist on seeing Madame
Walravens herself, and giving the basket into her own hands, in
order that there may be no mistake, for she is rather a punctilious
personage. Adieu! Au revoir!"</p>
<p id="id02846">And at last I got away. The shop commissions took
some time to execute, that choosing and matching of silks and wools
being always a tedious business, but at last I got through my list.
The patterns for the slippers, the bell-ropes, the cabas were
selected&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the slides and tassels for the purses
chosen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the whole "tripotage," in short, was off
my mind; nothing but the fruit and the felicitations remained to be
attended to.</p>
<p id="id02847">I rather liked the prospect of a long walk, deep
into the old and grim Basse-Ville; and I liked it no worse because
the evening sky, over the city, was settling into a mass of
black-blue metal, heated at the rim, and inflaming slowly to a
heavy red.</p>
<p id="id02848">I fear a high wind, because storm demands that
exertion of strength and use of action I always yield with pain;
but the sullen down-fall, the thick snow-descent, or dark rush of
rain, ask only resignation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the quiet abandonment
of garments and person to be, drenched. In return, it sweeps a
great capital clean before you; it makes you a quiet path through
broad, grand streets; it petrifies a living city as if by eastern
enchantment; it transforms a Villette into a Tadmor. Let, then, the
rains fall, and the floods descend&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;only I must
first get rid of this basket of fruit.</p>
<p id="id02849">An unknown clock from an unknown tower (Jean
Baptiste's voice was now too distant to be audible) was tolling the
third quarter past five, when I reached that street and house
whereof Madame Beck had given me the address. It was no street at
all; it seemed rather to be part of a square: it was quiet, grass
grew between the broad grey flags, the houses were large and looked
very old&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;behind them rose the appearance of
trees, indicating gardens at the back. Antiquity brooded above this
region, business was banished thence. Rich men had once possessed
this quarter, and once grandeur had made her seat here. That
church, whose dark, half-ruinous turrets overlooked the square, was
the venerable and formerly opulent shrine of the Magi. But wealth
and greatness had long since stretched their gilded pinions and
fled hence, leaving these their ancient nests, perhaps to house
Penury for a time, or perhaps to stand cold and empty, mouldering
untenanted in the course of winters.</p>
<p id="id02850">As I crossed this deserted "place," on whose
pavement drops almost as large as a five-franc piece were now
slowly darkening, I saw, in its whole expanse, no symptom or
evidence of life, except what was given in the figure of an infirm
old priest, who went past, bending and propped on a
staff&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the type of eld and decay.</p>
<p id="id02851">He had issued from the very house to which I was
directed; and when I paused before the door just closed after him,
and rang the bell, he turned to look at me. Nor did he soon avert
his gaze; perhaps he thought me, with my basket of summer fruit,
and my lack of the dignity age confers, an incongruous figure in
such a scene. I know, had a young ruddy-faced bonne opened the door
to admit me, I should have thought such a one little in harmony
with her dwelling; but, when I found myself confronted by a very
old woman, wearing a very antique peasant costume, a cap alike
hideous and costly, with long flaps of native lace, a petticoat and
jacket of cloth, and sabots more like little boats than shoes, it
seemed all right, and soothingly in character.</p>
<p id="id02852">The expression of her face was not quite so
soothing as the cut of her costume; anything more cantankerous I
have seldom seen; she would scarcely reply to my inquiry after
Madame Walravens; I believe she would have snatched the basket of
fruit from my hand, had not the old priest, hobbling up, checked
her, and himself lent an ear to the message with which I was
charged.</p>
<p id="id02853">His apparent deafness rendered it a little
difficult to make him fully understand that I must see Madame
Walravens, and consign the fruit into her own hands. At last,
however, he comprehended the fact that such were my orders, and
that duty enjoined their literal fulfilment. Addressing the aged
bonne, not in French, but in the aboriginal tongue of Labassecour,
he persuaded her, at last, to let me cross the inhospitable
threshold, and himself escorting me up-stairs, I was ushered into a
sort of salon, and there left.</p>
<p id="id02854">The room was large, and had a fine old ceiling, and
almost church-like windows of coloured-glass; but it was desolate,
and in the shadow of a coming storm, looked strangely lowering.
Within&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;opened a smaller room; there, however,
the blind of the single casement was closed; through the deep gloom
few details of furniture were apparent. These few I amused myself
by puzzling to make out; and, in particular, I was attracted by the
outline of a picture on the wall.</p>
<p id="id02855">By-and-by the picture seemed to give way: to my
bewilderment, it shook, it sunk, it rolled back into nothing; its
vanishing left an opening arched, leading into an arched passage,
with a mystic winding stair; both passage and stair were of cold
stone, uncarpeted and unpainted. Down this donjon stair descended a
tap, tap, like a stick; soon there fell on the steps a shadow, and
last of all, I was aware of a substance.</p>
<p id="id02856">Yet, was it actual substance, this appearance
approaching me? this obstruction, partially darkening the arch?</p>
<p id="id02857">It drew near, and I saw it well. I began to
comprehend where I was. Well might this old square be named quarter
of the Magi&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;well might the three towers,
overlooking it, own for godfathers three mystic sages of a dead and
dark art. Hoar enchantment here prevailed; a spell had opened for
me elf-land&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that cell-like room, that vanishing
picture, that arch and passage, and stair of stone, were all parts
of a fairy tale. Distincter even than these scenic details stood
the chief figure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Cunegonde, the sorceress!
Malevola, the evil fairy. How was she?</p>
<p id="id02858">She might be three feet high, but she had no shape;
her skinny hands rested upon each other, and pressed the gold knob
of a wand-like ivory staff. Her face was large, set, not upon her
shoulders, but before her breast; she seemed to have no neck; I
should have said there were a hundred years in her features, and
more perhaps in her eyes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her malign, unfriendly
eyes, with thick grey brows above, and livid lids all round. How
severely they viewed me, with a sort of dull displeasure!</p>
<p id="id02859">This being wore a gown of brocade, dyed bright
blue, full-tinted as the gentianella flower, and covered with satin
foliage in a large pattern; over the gown a costly shawl,
gorgeously bordered, and so large for her, that its many-coloured
fringe swept the floor. But her chief points were her jewels: she
had long, clear earrings, blazing with a lustre which could not be
borrowed or false; she had rings on her skeleton hands, with thick
gold hoops, and stones&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;purple, green, and
blood-red. Hunchbacked, dwarfish, and doting, she was adorned like
a barbarian queen.</p>
<p id="id02860">"Que me voulez-vous?" said she, hoarsely, with the
voice rather of male than of female old age; and, indeed, a silver
beard bristled her chin.</p>
<p id="id02861">I delivered my basket and my message.</p>
<p id="id02862">"Is that all?" she demanded.</p>
<p id="id02863">"It is all," said I.</p>
<p id="id02864">"Truly, it was well worth while," she answered.
"Return to Madame Beck, and tell her I can buy fruit when I want
it, et quant &Atilde;&nbsp; ses f&Atilde;&copy;licitations, je m'en
moque!" And this courteous dame turned her back.</p>
<p id="id02865">Just as she turned, a peal of thunder broke, and a
flash of lightning blazed broad over salon and boudoir. The tale of
magic seemed to proceed with due accompaniment of the elements. The
wanderer, decoyed into the enchanted castle, heard rising, outside,
the spell-wakened tempest.</p>
<p id="id02866">What, in all this, was I to think of Madame Beck?
She owned strange acquaintance; she offered messages and gifts at
an unique shrine, and inauspicious seemed the bearing of the
uncouth thing she worshipped. There went that sullen Sidonia,
tottering and trembling like palsy incarnate, tapping her ivory
staff on the mosaic parquet, and muttering venomously as she
vanished.</p>
<p id="id02867">Down washed the rain, deep lowered the welkin; the
clouds, ruddy a while ago, had now, through all their blackness,
turned deadly pale, as if in terror. Notwithstanding my late boast
about not fearing a shower, I hardly liked to go out under this
waterspout. Then the gleams of lightning were very fierce, the
thunder crashed very near; this storm had gathered immediately
above Villette; it seemed to have burst at the zenith; it rushed
down prone; the forked, slant bolts pierced athwart vertical
torrents; red zigzags interlaced a descent blanched as white metal:
and all broke from a sky heavily black in its swollen
abundance.</p>
<p id="id02868">Leaving Madame Walravens' inhospitable salon, I
betook myself to her cold staircase; there was a seat on the
landing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there I waited. Somebody came gliding
along the gallery just above; it was the old priest.</p>
<p id="id02869">"Indeed Mademoiselle shall not sit there," said he.
"It would displeasure our benefactor if he knew a stranger was so
treated in this house."</p>
<p id="id02870">And he begged me so earnestly to return to the
salon, that, without discourtesy, I could not but comply. The
smaller room was better furnished and more habitable than the
larger; thither he introduced me. Partially withdrawing the blind,
he disclosed what seemed more like an oratory than a boudoir, a
very solemn little chamber, looking as if it were a place rather
dedicated to relics and remembrance, than designed for present use
and comfort.</p>
<p id="id02871">The good father sat down, as if to keep me company;
but instead of conversing, he took out a book, fastened on the page
his eyes, and employed his lips in
whispering&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what sounded like a prayer or litany.
A yellow electric light from the sky gilded his bald head; his
figure remained in shade&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;deep and purple; he sat
still as sculpture; he seemed to forget me for his prayers; he only
looked up when a fiercer bolt, or a harsher, closer rattle told of
nearing danger; even then, it was not in fear, but in seeming awe,
he raised his eyes. I too was awe-struck; being, however, under no
pressure of slavish terror, my thoughts and observations were
free.</p>
<p id="id02872">To speak truth, I was beginning to fancy that the
old priest resembled that P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas, before whom I had
kneeled in the church of the B&Atilde;&copy;guinage. The idea was
vague, for I had seen my confessor only in dusk and in profile, yet
still I seemed to trace a likeness: I thought also I recognized the
voice. While I watched him, he betrayed, by one lifted look, that
he felt my scrutiny; I turned to note the room; that too had its
half mystic interest.</p>
<p id="id02873">Beside a cross of curiously carved old ivory,
yellow with time, and sloped above a dark-red <i>prie-dieu</i>,
furnished duly, with rich missal and ebon
rosary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hung the picture whose dim outline had
drawn my eyes before&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the picture which moved,
fell away with the wall and let in phantoms. Imperfectly seen, I
had taken it for a Madonna; revealed by clearer light, it proved to
be a woman's portrait in a nun's dress. The face, though not
beautiful, was pleasing; pale, young, and shaded with the dejection
of grief or ill health. I say again it was not beautiful; it was
not even intellectual; its very amiability was the amiability of a
weak frame, inactive passions, acquiescent habits: yet I looked
long at that picture, and could not choose but look.</p>
<p id="id02874">The old priest, who at first had seemed to me so
deaf and infirm, must yet have retained his faculties in tolerable
preservation; absorbed in his book as he appeared, without once
lifting his head, or, as far as I knew, turning his eyes, he
perceived the point towards which my attention was drawn, and, in a
slow distinct voice, dropped, concerning it, these four
observations:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02875">"She was much beloved.</p>
<p id="id02876">"She gave herself to God.</p>
<p id="id02877">"She died young.</p>
<p id="id02878">"She is still remembered, still wept."</p>
<p id="id02879">"By that aged lady, Madame Walravens?" I inquired,
fancying that I had discovered in the incurable grief of
bereavement, a key to that same aged lady's desperate
ill-humour.</p>
<p id="id02880">The father shook his head with half a smile.</p>
<p id="id02881">"No, no," said he; "a grand-dame's affection for
her children's children may be great, and her sorrow for their
loss, lively; but it is only the affianced lover, to whom Fate,
Faith, and Death have trebly denied the bliss of union, who mourns
what he has lost, as Justine Marie is still mourned."</p>
<p id="id02882">I thought the father rather wished to be
questioned, and therefore I inquired who had lost and who still
mourned "Justine Marie." I got, in reply, quite a little romantic
narrative, told not unimpressively, with the accompaniment of the
now subsiding storm. I am bound to say it might have been made much
more truly impressive, if there had been less French, Rousseau-like
sentimentalizing and wire-drawing; and rather more healthful
carelessness of effect. But the worthy father was obviously a
Frenchman born and bred (I became more and more persuaded of his
resemblance to my confessor)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he was a true son
of Rome; when he did lift his eyes, he looked at me out of their
corners, with more and sharper subtlety than, one would have
thought, could survive the wear and tear of seventy years. Yet, I
believe, he was a good old man.</p>
<p id="id02883">The hero of his tale was some former pupil of his,
whom he now called his benefactor, and who, it appears, had loved
this pale Justine Marie, the daughter of rich parents, at a time
when his own worldly prospects were such as to justify his aspiring
to a well-dowered hand. The pupil's father&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;once
a rich banker&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had failed, died, and left behind
him only debts and destitution. The son was then forbidden to think
of Marie; especially that old witch of a grand-dame I had seen,
Madame Walravens, opposed the match with all the violence of a
temper which deformity made sometimes demoniac. The mild Marie had
neither the treachery to be false, nor the force to be quite
staunch to her lover; she gave up her first suitor, but, refusing
to accept a second with a heavier purse, withdrew to a convent, and
there died in her noviciate.</p>
<p id="id02884">Lasting anguish, it seems, had taken possession of
the faithful heart which worshipped her, and the truth of that love
and grief had been shown in a manner which touched even me, as I
listened.</p>
<p id="id02885">Some years after Justine Marie's death, ruin had
come on her house too: her father, by nominal calling a jeweller,
but who also dealt a good deal on the Bourse, had been concerned in
some financial transactions which entailed exposure and ruinous
fines. He died of grief for the loss, and shame for the infamy. His
old hunchbacked mother and his bereaved wife were left penniless,
and might have died too of want; but their lost daughter's
once-despised, yet most true-hearted suitor, hearing of the
condition of these ladies, came with singular devotedness to the
rescue. He took on their insolent pride the revenge of the purest
charity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;housing, caring for, befriending them,
so as no son could have done it more tenderly and efficiently. The
mother&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on the whole a good
woman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;died blessing him; the strange, godless,
loveless, misanthrope grandmother lived still, entirely supported
by this self-sacrificing man. Her, who had been the bane of his
life, blighting his hope, and awarding him, for love and domestic
happiness, long mourning and cheerless solitude, he treated with
the respect a good son might offer a kind mother. He had brought
her to this house, "and," continued the priest, while genuine tears
rose to his eyes, "here, too, he shelters me, his old tutor, and
Agnes, a superannuated servant of his father's family. To our
sustenance, and to other charities, I know he devotes three-parts
of his income, keeping only the fourth to provide himself with
bread and the most modest accommodations. By this arrangement he
has rendered it impossible to himself ever to marry: he has given
himself to God and to his angel-bride as much as if he were a
priest, like me."</p>
<p id="id02886">The father had wiped away his tears before he
uttered these last words, and in pronouncing them, he for one
instant raised his eyes to mine. I caught this glance, despite its
veiled character; the momentary gleam shot a meaning which struck
me.</p>
<p id="id02887">These Romanists are strange beings. Such a one
among them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whom you know no more than the last
Inca of Peru, or the first Emperor of
China&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;knows you and all your concerns; and has
his reasons for saying to you so and so, when you simply thought
the communication sprang impromptu from the instant's impulse: his
plan in bringing it about that you shall come on such a day, to
such a place, under such and such circumstances, when the whole
arrangement seems to your crude apprehension the ordinance of
chance, or the sequel of exigency. Madame Beck's
suddenly-recollected message and present, my artless embassy to the
Place of the Magi, the old priest accidentally descending the steps
and crossing the square, his interposition on my behalf with the
bonne who would have sent me away, his reappearance on the
staircase, my introduction to this room, the portrait, the
narrative so affably volunteered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all these
little incidents, taken as they fell out, seemed each independent
of its successor; a handful of loose beads: but threaded through by
that quick-shot and crafty glance of a Jesuit-eye, they dropped
pendent in a long string, like that rosary on the prie-dieu. Where
lay the link of junction, where the little clasp of this monastic
necklace? I saw or felt union, but could not yet find the spot, or
detect the means of connection.</p>
<p id="id02888">Perhaps the musing-fit into which I had by this
time fallen, appeared somewhat suspicious in its abstraction; he
gently interrupted: "Mademoiselle," said he, "I trust you have not
far to go through these inundated streets?"</p>
<p id="id02889">"More than half a league."</p>
<p id="id02890">"You
live&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id02891">"In the Rue Fossette."</p>
<p id="id02892">"Not" (with animation), "not at the pensionnat of
Madame Beck?"</p>
<p id="id02893">"The same."</p>
<p id="id02894">"Donc" (clapping his hands), "donc, vous devez
conna&Atilde;&reg;tre mon noble &Atilde;&copy;l&Atilde;&uml;ve, mon
Paul?"</p>
<p id="id02895">"Monsieur Paul Emanuel, Professor of
Literature?"</p>
<p id="id02896">"He and none other."</p>
<p id="id02897">A brief silence fell. The spring of junction seemed
suddenly to have become palpable; I felt it yield to pressure.</p>
<p id="id02898">"Was it of M. Paul you have been speaking?" I
presently inquired. "Was he your pupil and the benefactor of Madame
Walravens?"</p>
<p id="id02899">"Yes, and of Agnes, the old servant: and moreover,
(with a certain emphasis), he was and <i>is</i> the lover, true,
constant and eternal, of that saint in
heaven&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Justine Marie."</p>
<p id="id02900">"And who, father, are <i>you?</i>" I continued; and
though I accentuated the question, its utterance was well nigh
superfluous; I was ere this quite prepared for the answer which
actually came.</p>
<p id="id02901">"I, daughter, am P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas; that
unworthy son of Holy Church whom you once honoured with a noble and
touching confidence, showing me the core of a heart, and the inner
shrine of a mind whereof, in solemn truth, I coveted the direction,
in behalf of the only true faith. Nor have I for a day lost sight
of you, nor for an hour failed to take in you a rooted interest.
Passed under the discipline of Rome, moulded by her high training,
inoculated with her salutary doctrines, inspired by the zeal she
alone gives&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I realize what then might be your
spiritual rank, your practical value; and I envy Heresy her
prey."</p>
<p id="id02902">This struck me as a special state of
things&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I half-realized myself in that condition
also; passed under discipline, moulded, trained, inoculated, and so
on. "Not so," thought I, but I restrained deprecation, and sat
quietly enough.</p>
<p id="id02903">"I suppose M. Paul does not live here?" I resumed,
pursuing a theme which I thought more to the purpose than any wild
renegade dreams.</p>
<p id="id02904">"No; he only comes occasionally to worship his
beloved saint, to make his confession to me, and to pay his
respects to her he calls his mother. His own lodging consists but
of two rooms: he has no servant, and yet he will not suffer Madame
Walravens to dispose of those splendid jewels with which you see
her adorned, and in which she takes a puerile pride as the
ornaments of her youth, and the last relics of her son the
jeweller's wealth."</p>
<p id="id02905">"How often," murmured I to myself, "has this man,
this M. Emanuel, seemed to me to lack magnanimity in trifles, yet
how great he is in great things!"</p>
<p id="id02906">I own I did not reckon amongst the proofs of his
greatness, either the act of confession, or the saint-worship.</p>
<p id="id02907">"How long is it since that lady died?" I inquired,
looking at Justine<br />
Marie.<br /></p>
<p id="id02908">"Twenty years. She was somewhat older than M.
Emanuel; he was then very young, for he is not much beyond
forty."</p>
<p id="id02909">"Does he yet weep her?"</p>
<p id="id02910">"His heart will weep her always: the essence of
Emanuel's nature is&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;constancy."</p>
<p id="id02911">This was said with marked emphasis.</p>
<p id="id02912">And now the sun broke out pallid and waterish; the
rain yet fell, but there was no more tempest: that hot firmament
had cloven and poured out its lightnings. A longer delay would
scarce leave daylight for my return, so I rose, thanked the father
for his hospitality and his tale, was benignantly answered by a
"pax vobiscum," which I made kindly welcome, because it seemed
uttered with a true benevolence; but I liked less the mystic phrase
accompanying it.</p>
<p id="id02913">"Daughter, you <i>shall</i> be what you
<i>shall</i> be!" an oracle that made me shrug my shoulders as soon
as I had got outside the door. Few of us know what we are to come
to certainly, but for all that had happened yet, I had good hopes
of living and dying a sober-minded Protestant: there was a
hollowness within, and a flourish around "Holy Church" which
tempted me but moderately. I went on my way pondering many things.
Whatever Romanism may be, there are good Romanists: this man,
Emanuel, seemed of the best; touched with superstition, influenced
by priestcraft, yet wondrous for fond faith, for pious devotion,
for sacrifice of self, for charity unbounded. It remained to see
how Rome, by her agents, handled such qualities; whether she
cherished them for their own sake and for God's, or put them out to
usury and made booty of the interest.</p>
<p id="id02914">By the time I reached home, it was sundown. Goton
had kindly saved me a portion of dinner, which indeed I needed. She
called me into the little cabinet to partake of it, and there
Madame Beck soon made her appearance, bringing me a glass of
wine.</p>
<p id="id02915">"Well," began she, chuckling, "and what sort of a
reception did Madame<br />
Walravens give you? Elle est dr&Atilde;&acute;le, n'est-ce
pas?"<br /></p>
<p id="id02916">I told her what had passed, delivering verbatim the
courteous message with which I had been charged.</p>
<p id="id02917">"Oh la singuli&Atilde;&uml;re petite bossue!"
laughed she. "Et figurez-vous qu'elle me d&Atilde;&copy;teste,
parcequ'elle me croit amoureuse de mon cousin Paul; ce petit
d&Atilde;&copy;vot qui n'ose pas bouger, &Atilde;&nbsp; moins que
son confesseur ne lui donne la permission! Au reste" (she went on),
"if he wanted to marry ever so much&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;soit moi,
soit une autre&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he could not do it; he has too
large a family already on his hands: M&Atilde;&uml;re Walravens,
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas, Dame Agnes, and a whole troop of nameless
paupers. There never was a man like him for laying on himself
burdens greater than he can bear, voluntarily incurring needless
responsibilities. Besides, he harbours a romantic idea about some
pale-faced Marie Justine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;personnage assez niaise
&Atilde;&nbsp; ce que je pense" (such was Madame's irreverent
remark), "who has been an angel in heaven, or elsewhere, this score
of years, and to whom he means to go, free from all earthly ties,
pure comme un lis, &Atilde;&nbsp; ce qu'il dit. Oh, you would laugh
could you but know half M. Emanuel's crotchets and eccentricities!
But I hinder you from taking refreshment, ma bonne Meess, which you
must need; eat your supper, drink your wine, oubliez les anges, les
bossues, et surtout, les Professeurs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;et bon
soir!"</p>
<h2 id="id02918" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h5 id="id02919">FRATERNITY.</h5>
<p id="id02920" style="margin-top: 2em">"Oubliez les Professeurs."
So said Madame Beck. Madame Beck was a wise woman, but she should
not have uttered those words. To do so was a mistake. That night
she should have left me calm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not excited,
indifferent, not interested, isolated in my own estimation and that
of others&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not connected, even in idea, with this
second person whom I was to forget.</p>
<p id="id02921">Forget him? Ah! they took a sage plan to make me
forget him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the wiseheads! They showed me how
good he was; they made of my dear little man a stainless little
hero. And then they had prated about his manner of loving. What
means had I, before this day, of being certain whether he could
love at all or not?</p>
<p id="id02922">I had known him jealous, suspicious; I had seen
about him certain tendernesses, fitfulnesses&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
softness which came like a warm air, and a ruth which passed like
early dew, dried in the heat of his irritabilities: <i>this</i> was
all I had seen. And they, P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas and Modeste Maria
Beck (that these two wrought in concert I could not doubt) opened
up the adytum of his heart&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;showed me one grand
love, the child of this southern nature's youth, born so strong and
perfect, that it had laughed at Death himself, despised his mean
rape of matter, clung to immortal spirit, and in victory and faith,
had watched beside a tomb twenty years.</p>
<p id="id02923">This had been done&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not idly:
this was not a mere hollow indulgence of sentiment; he had proven
his fidelity by the consecration of his best energies to an
unselfish purpose, and attested it by limitless personal
sacrifices: for those once dear to her he
prized&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he had laid down vengeance, and taken up
a cross.</p>
<p id="id02924">Now, as for Justine Marie, I knew what she was as
well as if I had seen her. I knew she was well enough; there were
girls like her in Madame Beck's
school&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;phlegmatics&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pale,
slow, inert, but kind-natured, neutral of evil, undistinguished for
good.</p>
<p id="id02925">If she wore angels' wings, I knew whose poet-fancy
conferred them. If her forehead shone luminous with the reflex of a
halo, I knew in the fire of whose irids that circlet of holy flame
had generation.</p>
<p id="id02926">Was I, then, to be frightened by Justine Marie? Was
the picture of a pale dead nun to rise, an eternal barrier? And
what of the charities which absorbed his worldly goods? What of his
heart sworn to virginity?</p>
<p id="id02927">Madame Beck&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;P&Atilde;&uml;re
Silas&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you should not have suggested these
questions. They were at once the deepest puzzle, the strongest
obstruction, and the keenest stimulus, I had ever felt. For a week
of nights and days I fell asleep&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I dreamt, and I
woke upon these two questions. In the whole world there was no
answer to them, except where one dark little man stood, sat,
walked, lectured, under the head-piece of a bandit bonnet-grec, and
within the girth of a sorry palet&Atilde;&acute;t, much be-inked,
and no little adust.</p>
<p id="id02928">After that visit to the Rue des Mages, I <i>did</i>
want to see him again. I felt as if&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;knowing what
I now knew&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his countenance would offer a page
more lucid, more interesting than ever; I felt a longing to trace
in it the imprint of that primitive devotedness, the signs of that
half-knightly, half-saintly chivalry which the priest's narrative
imputed to his nature. He had become my Christian hero: under that
character I wanted to view him.</p>
<p id="id02929">Nor was opportunity slow to favour; my new
impressions underwent her test the next day. Yes: I was granted an
interview with my "Christian hero"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an interview
not very heroic, or sentimental, or biblical, but lively enough in
its way.</p>
<p id="id02930">About three o'clock of the afternoon, the peace of
the first classe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;safely established, as it
seemed, under the serene sway of Madame Beck, who, <i>in
propri&Atilde;&cent; person&Atilde;&cent;</i> was giving one of her
orderly and useful lessons&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this peace, I say,
suffered a sudden fracture by the wild inburst of a
palet&Atilde;&acute;t.</p>
<p id="id02931">Nobody at the moment was quieter than myself. Eased
of responsibility by Madame Beck's presence, soothed by her uniform
tones, pleased and edified with her clear exposition of the subject
in hand (for she taught well), I sat bent over my desk,
drawing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is, copying an elaborate line
engraving, tediously working up my copy to the finish of the
original, for that was my practical notion of art; and, strange to
say, I took extreme pleasure in the labour, and could even produce
curiously finical Chinese facsimiles of steel or mezzotint
plates&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;things about as valuable as so many
achievements in worsted-work, but I thought pretty well of them in
those days.</p>
<p id="id02932">What was the matter? My drawing, my pencils, my
precious copy, gathered into one crushed-up handful, perished from
before my sight; I myself appeared to be shaken or emptied out of
my chair, as a solitary and withered nutmeg might be emptied out of
a spice-box by an excited cook. That chair and my desk, seized by
the wild palet&Atilde;&acute;t, one under each sleeve, were borne
afar; in a second, I followed the furniture; in two minutes they
and I were fixed in the centre of the grand
salle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a vast adjoining room, seldom used save
for dancing and choral singing-lessons&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fixed
with an emphasis which seemed to prohibit the remotest hope of our
ever being permitted to stir thence again.</p>
<p id="id02933">Having partially collected my scared wits, I found
myself in the presence of two men, gentlemen, I suppose I should
say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one dark, the other
light&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one having a stiff, half-military air, and
wearing a braided surtout; the other partaking, in garb and
bearing, more of the careless aspect of the student or artist
class: both flourishing in full magnificence of moustaches,
whiskers, and imperial. M. Emanuel stood a little apart from these;
his countenance and eyes expressed strong choler; he held forth his
hand with his tribune gesture.</p>
<p id="id02934">"Mademoiselle," said he, "your business is to prove
to these gentlemen that I am no liar. You will answer, to the best
of your ability, such questions as they shall put. You will also
write on such theme as they shall select. In their eyes, it
appears, I hold the position of an unprincipled impostor. I write
essays; and, with deliberate forgery, sign to them my pupils'
names, and boast of them as their work. You will disprove this
charge."</p>
<p id="id02935">Grand ciel! Here was the show-trial, so long
evaded, come on me like a thunder-clap. These two fine, braided,
mustachioed, sneering personages, were none other than dandy
professors of the college&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Messieurs Boissec and
Rochemorte&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a pair of cold-blooded fops and
pedants, sceptics, and scoffers. It seems that M. Paul had been
rashly exhibiting something I had
written&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something, he had never once praised, or
even mentioned, in my hearing, and which I deemed forgotten. The
essay was not remarkable at all; it only <i>seemed</i> remarkable,
compared with the average productions of foreign school-girls; in
an English establishment it would have passed scarce noticed.
Messieurs Boissec and Rochemorte had thought proper to question its
genuineness, and insinuate a cheat; I was now to bear my testimony
to the truth, and to be put to the torture of their
examination.</p>
<p id="id02936">A memorable scene ensued.</p>
<p id="id02937">They began with classics. A dead blank. They went
on to French history. I hardly knew
M&Atilde;&copy;rov&Atilde;&copy;e from Pharamond. They tried me in
various 'ologies, and still only got a shake of the head, and an
unchanging "Je n'en sais rien."</p>
<p id="id02938">After an expressive pause, they proceeded to
matters of general information, broaching one or two subjects which
I knew pretty well, and on which I had often reflected. M. Emanuel,
who had hitherto stood looking on, dark as the winter-solstice,
brightened up somewhat; he thought I should now show myself at
least no fool.</p>
<p id="id02939">He learned his error. Though answers to the
questions surged up fast, my mind filling like a rising well, ideas
were there, but not words. I either <i>could</i> not, or
<i>would</i> not speak&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am not sure which:
partly, I think, my nerves had got wrong, and partly my humour was
crossed.</p>
<p id="id02940">I heard one of my examiners&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he
of the braided surtout&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whisper to his
co-professor, "Est-elle donc idiote?"</p>
<p id="id02941">"Yes," I thought, "an idiot she is, and always will
be, for such as you."</p>
<p id="id02942">But I suffered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;suffered cruelly;
I saw the damps gather on M. Paul's brow, and his eye spoke a
passionate yet sad reproach. He would not believe in my total lack
of popular cleverness; he thought I <i>could</i> be prompt if I
<i>would</i>.</p>
<p id="id02943">At last, to relieve him, the professors, and
myself, I stammered out:</p>
<p id="id02944">"Gentlemen, you had better let me go; you will get
no good of me; as you say, I am an idiot."</p>
<p id="id02945">I wish I could have spoken with calm and dignity,
or I wish my sense had sufficed to make me hold my tongue; that
traitor tongue tripped, faltered. Beholding the judges cast on M.
Emanuel a hard look of triumph, and hearing the distressed tremor
of my own voice, out I burst in a fit of choking tears. The emotion
was far more of anger than grief; had I been a man and strong, I
could have challenged that pair on the spot&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but
it <i>was</i> emotion, and I would rather have been scourged than
betrayed it.</p>
<p id="id02946">The incapables! Could they not see at once the
crude hand of a novice in that composition they called a forgery?
The subject was classical. When M. Paul dictated the trait on which
the essay was to turn, I heard it for the first time; the matter
was new to me, and I had no material for its treatment. But I got
books, read up the facts, laboriously constructed a skeleton out of
the dry bones of the real, and then clothed them, and tried to
breathe into them life, and in this last aim I had pleasure. With
me it was a difficult and anxious time till my facts were found,
selected, and properly jointed; nor could I rest from research and
effort till I was satisfied of correct anatomy; the strength of my
inward repugnance to the idea of flaw or falsity sometimes enabled
me to shun egregious blunders; but the knowledge was not there in
my head, ready and mellow; it had not been sown in Spring, grown in
Summer, harvested in Autumn, and garnered through Winter; whatever
I wanted I must go out and gather fresh; glean of wild herbs my
lapful, and shred them green into the pot. Messieurs Boissec and
Rochemorte did not perceive this. They mistook my work for the work
of a ripe scholar.</p>
<p id="id02947">They would not yet let me go: I must sit down and
write before them. As I dipped my pen in the ink with a shaking
hand, and surveyed the white paper with eyes half-blinded and
overflowing, one of my judges began mincingly to apologize for the
pain he caused.</p>
<p id="id02948">"Nous agissons dans
l'int&Atilde;&copy;r&Atilde;&ordf;t de la
v&Atilde;&copy;rit&Atilde;&copy;. Nous ne voulons pas vous
blesser," said he.</p>
<p id="id02949">Scorn gave me nerve. I only
answered,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02950">"Dictate, Monsieur."</p>
<p id="id02951">Rochemorte named this theme: "Human Justice."</p>
<p id="id02952">Human Justice! What was I to make of it? Blank,
cold abstraction, unsuggestive to me of one inspiring idea; and
there stood M. Emanuel, sad as Saul, and stern as Joab, and there
triumphed his accusers.</p>
<p id="id02953">At these two I looked. I was gathering my courage
to tell them that I would neither write nor speak another word for
their satisfaction, that their theme did not suit, nor their
presence inspire me, and that, notwithstanding, whoever threw the
shadow of a doubt on M. Emanuel's honour, outraged that truth of
which they had announced themselves
the&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;champions: I <i>meant</i> to utter all this,
I say, when suddenly, a light darted on memory.</p>
<p id="id02954">Those two faces looking out of the forest of long
hair, moustache, and whisker&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;those two cold yet
bold, trustless yet presumptuous visages&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;were
the same faces, the very same that, projected in full gaslight from
behind the pillars of a portico, had half frightened me to death on
the night of my desolate arrival in Villette. These, I felt morally
certain, were the very heroes who had driven a friendless foreigner
beyond her reckoning and her strength, chased her breathless over a
whole quarter of the town.</p>
<p id="id02955">"Pious mentors!" thought I. "Pure guides for youth!
If `Human Justice' were what she ought to be, you two would scarce
hold your present post, or enjoy your present credit."</p>
<p id="id02956">An idea once seized, I fell to work. "Human
Justice" rushed before me in novel guise, a red, random beldame,
with arms akimbo. I saw her in her house, the den of confusion:
servants called to her for orders or help which she did not give;
beggars stood at her door waiting and starving unnoticed; a swarm
of children, sick and quarrelsome, crawled round her feet, and
yelled in her ears appeals for notice, sympathy, cure, redress. The
honest woman cared for none of these things. She had a warm seat of
her own by the fire, she had her own solace in a short black pipe,
and a bottle of Mrs. Sweeny's soothing syrup; she smoked and she
sipped, and she enjoyed her paradise; and whenever a cry of the
suffering souls about her 'pierced her ears too
keenly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my jolly dame seized the poker or the
hearth-brush: if the offender was weak, wronged, and sickly, she
effectually settled him: if he was strong, lively, and violent, she
only menaced, then plunged her hand in her deep pouch, and flung a
liberal shower of sugar-plums.</p>
<p id="id02957">Such was the sketch of "Human Justice," scratched
hurriedly on paper, and placed at the service of Messrs. Boissec
and Rochemorte. M. Emanuel read it over my shoulder. Waiting no
comment, I curtsied to the trio, and withdrew.</p>
<p id="id02958">After school that day, M. Paul and I again met. Of
course the meeting did not at first run smooth; there was a crow to
pluck with him; that forced examination could not be immediately
digested. A crabbed dialogue terminated in my being called "une
petite moqueuse et sans-coeur," and in Monsieur's temporary
departure.</p>
<p id="id02959">Not wishing him to go quite away, only desiring he
should feel that such a transport as he had that day given way to,
could not be indulged with perfect impunity, I was not sorry to see
him, soon after, gardening in the berceau. He approached the glass
door; I drew near also. We spoke of some flowers growing round it.
By-and-by Monsieur laid down his spade; by-and-by he recommenced
conversation, passed to other subjects, and at last touched a point
of interest.</p>
<p id="id02960">Conscious that his proceeding of that day was
specially open to a charge of extravagance, M. Paul half
apologized; he half regretted, too, the fitfulness of his moods at
all times, yet he hinted that some allowance ought to be made for
him. "But," said he, "I can hardly expect it at your hands, Miss
Lucy; you know neither me, nor my position, nor my history."</p>
<p id="id02961">His history. I took up the word at once; I pursued
the idea.</p>
<p id="id02962">"No, Monsieur," I rejoined. "Of course, as you say,
I know neither your history, nor your position, nor your
sacrifices, nor any of your sorrows, or trials, or affections, or
fidelities. Oh, no! I know nothing about you; you are for me
altogether a stranger."</p>
<p id="id02963">"Hein?" he murmured, arching his brows in
surprise.</p>
<p id="id02964">"You know, Monsieur, I only see you in
classe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stern, dogmatic, hasty, imperious. I only
hear of you in town as active and wilful, quick to originate, hasty
to lead, but slow to persuade, and hard to bend. A man like you,
without ties, can have no attachments; without dependants, no
duties. All we, with whom you come in contact, are machines, which
you thrust here and there, inconsiderate of their feelings. You
seek your recreations in public, by the light of the evening
chandelier: this school and yonder college are your workshops,
where you fabricate the ware called pupils. I don't so much as know
where you live; it is natural to take it for granted that you have
no home, and need none."</p>
<p id="id02965">"I am judged," said he. "Your opinion of me is just
what I thought it was. For you I am neither a man nor a Christian.
You see me void of affection and religion, unattached by friend or
family, unpiloted by principle or faith. It is well, Mademoiselle;
such is our reward in this life."</p>
<p id="id02966">"You are a philosopher, Monsieur; a cynic
philosopher" (and I looked at his palet&Atilde;&acute;t, of which
he straightway brushed the dim sleeve with his hand), "despising
the foibles of humanity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;above its
luxuries&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;independent of its comforts."</p>
<p id="id02967">"Et vous, Mademoiselle? vous &Atilde;&ordf;tes
proprette et douillette, et affreusement insensible, par-dessus le
march&Atilde;&copy;."</p>
<p id="id02968">"But, in short, Monsieur, now I think of it, you
<i>must</i> live somewhere?<br />
Do tell me where; and what establishment of servants do you
keep?"<br /></p>
<p id="id02969">With a fearful projection of the under-lip,
implying an impetus of scorn the most decided, he broke
out&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id02970">"Je vis dans un trou! I inhabit a den,
Miss&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a cavern, where you would not put your
dainty nose. Once, with base shame of speaking the whole truth, I
talked about my 'study' in that college: know now that this 'study'
is my whole abode; my chamber is there and my drawing-room. As for
my 'establishment of servants'" (mimicking my voice) "they number
ten; les voil&Atilde;&nbsp;."</p>
<p id="id02971">And he grimly spread, close under my eyes, his ten
fingers.</p>
<p id="id02972">"I black my boots," pursued he savagely. "I brush
my palet&Atilde;&acute;t."</p>
<p id="id02973">"No, Monsieur, it is too plain; you never do that,"
was my parenthesis.</p>
<p id="id02974">"Je fais mon lit et mon m&Atilde;&copy;nage; I seek
my dinner in a restaurant; my supper takes care, of itself; I pass
days laborious and loveless; nights long and lonely; I am
ferocious, and bearded and monkish; and nothing now living in this
world loves me, except some old hearts worn like my own, and some
few beings, impoverished, suffering, poor in purse and in spirit,
whom the kingdoms of this world own not, but to whom a will and
testament not to be disputed has bequeathed the kingdom of
heaven."</p>
<p id="id02975">"Ah, Monsieur; but I know!"</p>
<p id="id02976">"What do you know? many things, I verily believe;
yet not me, Lucy!"</p>
<p id="id02977">"I know that you have a pleasant old house in a
pleasant old square of the Basse-Ville&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;why don't
you go and live there?"</p>
<p id="id02978">"Hein?" muttered he again.</p>
<p id="id02979">"I liked it much, Monsieur; with the steps
ascending to the door, the grey flags in front, the nodding trees
behind&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;real trees, not
shrubs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;trees dark, high, and of old growth. And
the boudoir-oratoire&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you should make that room
your study; it is so quiet and solemn."</p>
<p id="id02980">He eyed me closely; he half-smiled, half-coloured.
"Where did you pick up all that? Who told you?" he asked.</p>
<p id="id02981">"Nobody told me. Did I dream it, Monsieur, do you
think?"</p>
<p id="id02982">"Can I enter into your visions? Can I guess a
woman's waking thoughts, much less her sleeping fantasies?"</p>
<p id="id02983">"If I dreamt it, I saw in my dream human beings as
well as a house. I saw a priest, old, bent, and grey, and a
domestic&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;old, too, and picturesque; and a lady,
splendid but strange; her head would scarce reach to my
elbow&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her magnificence might ransom a duke. She
wore a gown bright as lapis-lazuli&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a shawl worth
a thousand francs: she was decked with ornaments so brilliant, I
never saw any with such a beautiful sparkle; but her figure looked
as if it had been broken in two and bent double; she seemed also to
have outlived the common years of humanity, and to have attained
those which are only labour and sorrow. She was become
morose&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost malevolent; yet <i>somebody</i>,
it appears, cared for her in her
infirmities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;somebody forgave her trespasses,
hoping to have his trespasses forgiven. They lived together, these
three people&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the mistress, the chaplain, the
servant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all old, all feeble, all sheltered under
one kind wing."</p>
<p id="id02984">He covered with his hand the upper part of his
face, but did not conceal his mouth, where I saw hovering an
expression I liked.</p>
<p id="id02985">"I see you have entered into my secrets," said he,
"but how was it done?"</p>
<p id="id02986">So I told him how&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the commission
on which I had been sent, the storm which had detained me, the
abruptness of the lady, the kindness of the priest.</p>
<p id="id02987">"As I sat waiting for the rain to cease,
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas whiled away the time with a story," I
said.</p>
<p id="id02988">"A story! What story? P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas is no
romancist."</p>
<p id="id02989">"Shall I tell Monsieur the tale?"</p>
<p id="id02990">"Yes: begin at the beginning. Let me hear some of
Miss Lucy's French&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her best or her
worst&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I don't much care which: let us have a
good poign&Atilde;&copy;e of barbarisms, and a bounteous dose of
the insular accent."</p>
<p id="id02991">"Monsieur is not going to be gratified by a tale of
ambitious proportions, and the spectacle of the narrator sticking
fast in the midst. But I will tell him the
title&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the 'Priest's Pupil.'"</p>
<p id="id02992">"Bah!" said he, the swarthy flush again dyeing his
dark cheek. "The good old father could not have chosen a worse
subject; it is his weak point. But what of the 'Priest's
Pupil?'"</p>
<p id="id02993">"Oh! many things."</p>
<p id="id02994">"You may as well define <i>what</i> things. I mean
to know."</p>
<p id="id02995">"There was the pupil's youth, the pupil's
manhood;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his avarice, his ingratitude, his
implacability, his inconstancy. Such a bad pupil,
Monsieur!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so thankless, cold-hearted,
unchivalrous, unforgiving!</p>
<p id="id02996">"Et puis?" said he, taking a cigar.</p>
<p id="id02997">"Et puis," I pursued, "he underwent calamities
which one did not pity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bore them in a spirit one
did not admire&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;endured wrongs for which one felt
no sympathy; finally took the unchristian revenge of heaping coals
of fire on his adversary's head."</p>
<p id="id02998">"You have not told me all," said he.</p>
<p id="id02999">"Nearly all, I think: I have indicated the heads of
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas's chapters."</p>
<p id="id03000">"You have forgotten one-that which touched on the
pupil's lack of affection&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;on his hard, cold,
monkish heart."</p>
<p id="id03001">"True; I remember now. P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas
<i>did</i> say that his vocation was almost that of a
priest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that his life was considered
consecrated."</p>
<p id="id03002">"By what bonds or duties?"</p>
<p id="id03003">"By the ties of the past and the charities of the
present."</p>
<p id="id03004">"You have, then, the whole situation?"</p>
<p id="id03005">"I have now told Monsieur all that was told
me."</p>
<p id="id03006">Some meditative minutes passed.</p>
<p id="id03007">"Now, Mademoiselle Lucy, look at me, and with that
truth which I believe you never knowingly violate, answer me one
question. Raise your eyes; rest them on mine; have no hesitation;
fear not to trust me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am a man to be
trusted."</p>
<p id="id03008">I raised my eyes.</p>
<p id="id03009">"Knowing me thoroughly now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all
my antecedents, all my responsibilities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;having
long known my faults, can you and I still be friends?"</p>
<p id="id03010">"If Monsieur wants a friend in me, I shall be glad
to have a friend in him."</p>
<p id="id03011">"But a close friend I
mean&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;intimate and
real&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;kindred in all but blood. Will Miss Lucy be
the sister of a very poor, fettered, burdened, encumbered man?"</p>
<p id="id03012">I could not answer him in words, yet I suppose I
<i>did</i> answer him; he took my hand, which found comfort, in the
shelter of his. <i>His</i> friendship was not a doubtful, wavering
benefit&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a cold, distant
hope&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sentiment so brittle as not to bear the
weight of a finger: I at once felt (or <i>thought</i> I felt) its
support like that of some rock.</p>
<p id="id03013">"When I talk of friendship, I mean <i>true</i>
friendship," he repeated emphatically; and I could hardly believe
that words so earnest had blessed my ear; I hardly could credit the
reality of that kind, anxious look he gave. If he <i>really</i>
wished for my confidence and regard, and <i>really</i> would give
me his&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;why, it seemed to me that life could
offer nothing more or better. In that case, I was become strong and
rich: in a moment I was made substantially happy. To ascertain the
fact, to fix and seal it, I asked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03014">"Is Monsieur quite serious? Does he really think he
needs me, and can take an interest in me as a sister?"</p>
<p id="id03015">"Surely, surely," said he; "a lonely man like me,
who has no sister, must be but too glad to find in some woman's
heart a sister's pure affection."</p>
<p id="id03016">"And dare I rely on Monsieur's regard? Dare I speak
to him when I am so inclined?"</p>
<p id="id03017">"My little sister must make her own experiments,"
said he; "I will give no promises. She must tease and try her
wayward brother till she has drilled him into what she wishes.
After all, he is no inductile material in some hands."</p>
<p id="id03018">While he spoke, the tone of his voice, the light of
his now affectionate eye, gave me such a pleasure as, certainly, I
had never felt. I envied no girl her lover, no bride her
bridegroom, no wife her husband; I was content with this my
voluntary, self-offering friend. If he would but prove reliable,
and he <i>looked</i> reliable, what, beyond his friendship, could I
ever covet? But, if all melted like a dream, as once before had
happened&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?</p>
<p id="id03019">"Qu'est-ce donc? What is it?" said he, as this
thought threw its weight on my heart, its shadow on my countenance.
I told him; and after a moment's pause, and a thoughtful smile, he
showed me how an equal fear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;lest I should weary
of him, a man of moods so difficult and
fitful&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had haunted his mind for more than one
day, or one month.</p>
<p id="id03020">On hearing this, a quiet courage cheered me. I
ventured a word of re-assurance. That word was not only tolerated;
its repetition was courted. I grew quite
happy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strangely happy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in
making him secure, content, tranquil. Yesterday, I could not have
believed that earth held, or life afforded, moments like the few I
was now passing. Countless times it had been my lot to watch
apprehended sorrow close darkly in; but to see unhoped-for
happiness take form, find place, and grow more real as the seconds
sped, was indeed a new experience.</p>
<p id="id03021">"Lucy," said M. Paul, speaking low, and still
holding my hand, "did you see a picture in the boudoir of the old
house?"</p>
<p id="id03022">"I did; a picture painted on a panel."</p>
<p id="id03023">"The portrait of a nun?"</p>
<p id="id03024">"Yes."</p>
<p id="id03025">"You heard her history?"</p>
<p id="id03026">"Yes."</p>
<p id="id03027">"You remember what we saw that night in the
berceau?"</p>
<p id="id03028">"I shall never forget it."</p>
<p id="id03029">"You did not connect the two ideas; that would be
folly?"</p>
<p id="id03030">"I thought of the apparition when I saw the
portrait," said I; which was true enough.</p>
<p id="id03031">"You did not, nor will you fancy," pursued he,
"that a saint in heaven perturbs herself with rivalries of earth?
Protestants are rarely superstitious; these morbid fancies will not
beset <i>you?</i>"</p>
<p id="id03032">"I know not what to think of this matter; but I
believe a perfectly natural solution of this seeming mystery will
one day be arrived at."</p>
<p id="id03033">"Doubtless, doubtless. Besides, no good-living
woman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;much less a pure, happy spirit-would
trouble amity like ours n'est-il pas vrai?"</p>
<p id="id03034">Ere I could answer, Fifine Beck burst in, rosy and
abrupt, calling out that I was wanted. Her mother was going into
town to call on some English family, who had applied for a
prospectus: my services were needed as interpreter. The
interruption was not unseasonable: sufficient for the day is always
the evil; for this hour, its good sufficed. Yet I should have liked
to ask M. Paul whether the "morbid fancies," against which he
warned me, wrought in his own brain.</p>
<h2 id="id03035" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h5 id="id03036">THE APPLE OF DISCORD.</h5>
<p id="id03037" style="margin-top: 2em">Besides Fifine Beck's
mother, another power had a word to say to M. Paul and me, before
that covenant of friendship could be ratified. We were under the
surveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously her son
through that mystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to which
M. Emanuel drew nigh month by month&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the sliding
panel of the confessional.</p>
<p id="id03038">"Why were you so glad to be friends with M. Paul?"
asks the reader. "Had he not long been a friend to you? Had he not
given proof on proof of a certain partiality in his feelings?"</p>
<p id="id03039">Yes, he had; but still I liked to hear him say so
earnestly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that he was my close, true friend; I
liked his modest doubts, his tender
deference&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that trust which longed to rest, and
was grateful when taught how. He had called me "sister." It was
well. Yes; he might call me what he pleased, so long as he confided
in me. I was willing to be his sister, on condition that he did not
invite me to fill that relation to some future wife of his; and
tacitly vowed as he was to celibacy, of this dilemma there seemed
little danger.</p>
<p id="id03040">Through most of the succeeding night I pondered
that evening's interview. I wanted much the morning to break, and
then listened for the bell to ring; and, after rising and dressing,
I deemed prayers and breakfast slow, and all the hours lingering,
till that arrived at last which brought me the lesson of
literature. My wish was to get a more thorough comprehension of
this fraternal alliance: to note with how much of the brother he
would demean himself when we met again; to prove how much of the
sister was in my own feelings; to discover whether I could summon a
sister's courage, and he a brother's frankness.</p>
<p id="id03041">He came. Life is so constructed, that the event
does not, cannot, will not, match the expectation. That whole day
he never accosted me. His lesson was given rather more quietly than
usual, more mildly, and also more gravely. He was fatherly to his
pupils, but he was not brotherly to me. Ere he left the classe, I
expected a smile, if not a word; I got neither: to my portion fell
one nod&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;hurried, shy.</p>
<p id="id03042">This distance, I argued, is
accidental&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is involuntary; patience, and it
will vanish. It vanished not; it continued for days; it increased.
I suppressed my surprise, and swallowed whatever other feelings
began to surge.</p>
<p id="id03043">Well might I ask when he offered
fraternity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Dare I rely on you?" Well might he,
doubtless knowing himself, withhold all pledge. True, he had bid me
make my own experiments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;tease and try him. Vain
injunction! Privilege nominal and unavailable! Some women might use
it! Nothing in my powers or instinct placed me amongst this brave
band. Left alone, I was passive; repulsed, I withdrew;
forgotten&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my lips would not utter, nor my eyes
dart a reminder. It seemed there had been an error somewhere in my
calculations, and I wanted for time to disclose it.</p>
<p id="id03044">But the day came when, as usual, he was to give me
a lesson. One evening in seven he had long generously bestowed on
me, devoting it to the examination of what had been done in various
studies during the past week, and to the preparation of work for
the week in prospect. On these occasions my schoolroom was
anywhere, wherever the pupils and the other teachers happened to
be, or in their close vicinage, very often in the large second
division, where it was easy to choose a quiet nook when the
crowding day pupils were absent, and the few boarders gathered in a
knot about the surveillante's estrade.</p>
<p id="id03045">On the customary evening, hearing the customary
hour strike, I collected my books and papers, my pen and ink, and
sought the large division.</p>
<p id="id03046">In classe there was no one, and it lay all in cool
deep shadow; but through the open double doors was seen the
carr&Atilde;&copy;, filled with pupils and with light; over hall
and figures blushed the westering sun. It blushed so ruddily and
vividly, that the hues of the walls and the variegated tints of the
dresses seemed all fused in one warm glow. The girls were seated,
working or studying; in the midst of their circle stood M. Emanuel,
speaking good-humouredly to a teacher. His dark
palet&Atilde;&acute;t, his jetty hair, were tinged with many a
reflex of crimson; his Spanish face, when he turned it momentarily,
answered the sun's animated kiss with an animated smile. I took my
place at a desk.</p>
<p id="id03047">The orange-trees, and several plants, full and
bright with bloom, basked also in the sun's laughing bounty; they
had partaken it the whole day, and now asked water. M. Emanuel had
a taste for gardening; he liked to tend and foster plants. I used
to think that working amongst shrubs with a spade or a watering-pot
soothed his nerves; it was a recreation to which he often had
recourse; and now he looked to the orange-trees, the geraniums, the
gorgeous cactuses, and revived them all with the refreshment their
drought needed. His lips meantime sustained his precious cigar,
that (for him) first necessary and prime luxury of life; its blue
wreaths curled prettily enough amongst the flowers, and in the
evening light. He spoke no more to the pupils, nor to the
mistresses, but gave many an endearing word to a small spanieless
(if one may coin a word), that nominally belonged to the house, but
virtually owned him as master, being fonder of him than any inmate.
A delicate, silky, loving, and lovable little doggie she was,
trotting at his side, looking with expressive, attached eyes into
his face; and whenever he dropped his bonnet-grec or his
handkerchief, which he occasionally did in play, crouching beside
it with the air of a miniature lion guarding a kingdom's flag.</p>
<p id="id03048">There were many plants, and as the amateur gardener
fetched all the water from the well in the court, with his own
active hands, his work spun on to some length. The great
school-clock ticked on. Another hour struck. The carr&Atilde;&copy;
and the youthful group lost the illusion of sunset. Day was
drooping. My lesson, I perceived, must to-night be very short; but
the orange-trees, the cacti, the camelias were all served now. Was
it my turn?</p>
<p id="id03049">Alas! in the garden were more plants to be looked
after,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;favourite rose-bushes, certain choice
flowers; little Sylvie's glad bark and whine followed the receding
palet&Atilde;&acute;t down the alleys. I put up some of my books; I
should not want them all; I sat and thought; and waited,
involuntarily deprecating the creeping invasion of twilight.</p>
<p id="id03050">Sylvie, gaily frisking, emerged into view once
more, heralding the returning palet&Atilde;&acute;t; the
watering-pot was deposited beside the well; it had fulfilled its
office; how glad I was! Monsieur washed his hands in a little stone
bowl. There was no longer time for a lesson now; ere long the
prayer-bell must ring; but still we should meet; he would speak; a
chance would be offered of reading in his eyes the riddle of his
shyness. His ablutions over, he stood, slowly re-arranging his
cuffs, looking at the horn of a young moon, set pale in the opal
sky, and glimmering faint on the oriel of Jean Baptiste. Sylvie
watched the mood contemplative; its stillness irked her; she whined
and jumped to break it. He looked down.</p>
<p id="id03051">"Petite exigeante," said he; "you must not be
forgotten one moment, it seems."</p>
<p id="id03052">He stopped, lifted her in his arms, sauntered
across the court, within a yard of the line of windows near one of
which I sat: he sauntered lingeringly, fondling the spaniel in his
bosom, calling her tender names in a tender voice. On the
front-door steps he turned; once again he looked at the moon, at
the grey cathedral, over the remoter spires and house-roofs fading
into a blue sea of night-mist; he tasted the sweet breath of dusk,
and noted the folded bloom of the garden; he suddenly looked round;
a keen beam out of his eye rased the white fa&Atilde;&sect;ade of
the classes, swept the long line of crois&Atilde;&copy;es. I think
he bowed; if he did, I had no time to return the courtesy. In a
moment he was gone; the moonlit threshold lay pale and shadowless
before the closed front door.</p>
<p id="id03053">Gathering in my arms all that was spread on the
desk before me, I carried back the unused heap to its place in the
third classe. The prayer-bell rang; I obeyed its summons.</p>
<p id="id03054">The morrow would not restore him to the Rue
Fossette, that day being devoted entirely to his college. I got
through my teaching; I got over the intermediate hours; I saw
evening approaching, and armed myself for its heavy ennuis. Whether
it was worse to stay with my co-inmates, or to sit alone, I had not
considered; I naturally took up the latter alternative; if there
was a hope of comfort for any moment, the heart or head of no human
being in this house could yield it; only under the lid of my desk
could it harbour, nestling between the leaves of some book, gilding
a pencil-point, the nib of a pen, or tinging the black fluid in
that ink-glass. With a heavy heart I opened my desk-lid; with a
weary hand I turned up its contents.</p>
<p id="id03055">One by one, well-accustomed books, volumes sewn in
familiar covers, were taken out and put back hopeless: they had no
charm; they could not comfort. Is this something new, this pamphlet
in lilac? I had not seen it before, and I re-arranged my desk this
very day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this very afternoon; the tract must
have been introduced within the last hour, while we were at
dinner.</p>
<p id="id03056">I opened it. What was it? What would it say to
me?</p>
<p id="id03057">It was neither tale nor poem, neither essay nor
history; it neither sung, nor related, not discussed. It was a
theological work; it preached and it persuaded.</p>
<p id="id03058">I lent to it my ear very willingly, for, small as
it was, it possessed its own spell, and bound my attention at once.
It preached Romanism; it persuaded to conversion. The voice of that
sly little book was a honeyed voice; its accents were all unction
and balm. Here roared no utterance of Rome's thunders, no blasting
of the breath of her displeasure. The Protestant was to turn
Papist, not so much in fear of the heretic's hell, as on account of
the comfort, the indulgence, the tenderness Holy Church offered:
far be it from her to threaten or to coerce; her wish was to guide
and win. <i>She</i> persecute? Oh dear no! not on any account!</p>
<p id="id03059">This meek volume was not addressed to the hardened
and worldly; it was not even strong meat for the strong: it was
milk for babes: the mild effluence of a mother's love towards her
tenderest and her youngest; intended wholly and solely for those
whose head is to be reached through the heart. Its appeal was not
to intellect; it sought to win the affectionate through their
affections, the sympathizing through their sympathies: St. Vincent
de Paul, gathering his orphans about him, never spoke more
sweetly.</p>
<p id="id03060">I remember one capital inducement to apostacy was
held out in the fact that the Catholic who had lost dear friends by
death could enjoy the unspeakable solace of praying them out of
purgatory. The writer did not touch on the firmer peace of those
whose belief dispenses with purgatory altogether: but I thought of
this; and, on the whole, preferred the latter doctrine as the most
consolatory. The little book amused, and did not painfully
displease me. It was a canting, sentimental, shallow little book,
yet something about it cheered my gloom and made me smile; I was
amused with the gambols of this unlicked wolf-cub muffled in the
fleece, and mimicking the bleat of a guileless lamb. Portions of it
reminded me of certain Wesleyan Methodist tracts I had once read
when a child; they were flavoured with about the same seasoning of
excitation to fanaticism. He that had written it was no bad man,
and while perpetually betraying the trained
cunning&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the cloven hoof of his
system&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I should pause before accusing himself of
insincerity. His judgment, however, wanted surgical props; it was
rickety.</p>
<p id="id03061">I smiled then over this dose of maternal
tenderness, coming from the ruddy old lady of the Seven Hills;
smiled, too, at my own disinclination, not to say disability, to
meet these melting favours. Glancing at the title-page, I found the
name of "P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas." A fly-leaf bore in small, but
clear and well-known pencil characters: "From P. C. D. E. to
L&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;y." And when I saw this I laughed: but not in
my former spirit. I was revived.</p>
<p id="id03062">A mortal bewilderment cleared suddenly from my head
and vision; the solution of the Sphinx-riddle was won; the
conjunction of those two names, P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas and Paul
Emanuel, gave the key to all. The penitent had been with his
director; permitted to withhold nothing; suffered to keep no corner
of his heart sacred to God and to himself; the whole narrative of
our late interview had been drawn from him; he had avowed the
covenant of fraternity, and spoken of his adopted sister. How could
such a covenant, such adoption, be sanctioned by the Church?
Fraternal communion with a heretic! I seemed to hear
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas annulling the unholy pact; warning his
penitent of its perils; entreating, enjoining reserve, nay, by the
authority of his office, and in the name, and by the memory of all
M. Emanuel held most dear and sacred, commanding the enforcement of
that new system whose frost had pierced to the marrow of my
bones.</p>
<p id="id03063">These may not seem pleasant hypotheses; yet, by
comparison, they were welcome. The vision of a ghostly troubler
hovering in the background, was as nothing, matched with the fear
of spontaneous change arising in M. Paul himself.</p>
<p id="id03064">At this distance of time, I cannot be sure how far
the above conjectures were self-suggested: or in what measure they
owed their origin and confirmation to another quarter. Help was not
wanting.</p>
<p id="id03065">This evening there was no bright sunset: west and
east were one cloud; no summer night-mist, blue, yet rose-tinged,
softened the distance; a clammy fog from the marshes crept grey
round Villette. To-night the watering-pot might rest in its niche
by the well: a small rain had been drizzling all the afternoon, and
still it fell fast and quietly. This was no weather for rambling in
the wet alleys, under the dripping trees; and I started to hear
Sylvie's sudden bark in the garden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her bark of
welcome. Surely she was not accompanied and yet this glad, quick
bark was never uttered, save in homage to one presence.</p>
<p id="id03066">Through the glass door and the arching berceau, I
commanded the deep vista of the all&Atilde;&copy;e
d&Atilde;&copy;fendue: thither rushed Sylvie, glistening through
its gloom like a white guelder-rose. She ran to and fro, whining,
springing, harassing little birds amongst the bushes. I watched
five minutes; no fulfilment followed the omen. I returned to my
books; Sylvie's sharp bark suddenly ceased. Again I looked up. She
was standing not many yards distant, wagging her white feathery
tail as fast as the muscle would work, and intently watching the
operations of a spade, plied fast by an indefatigable hand. There
was M. Emanuel, bent over the soil, digging in the wet mould
amongst the rain-laden and streaming shrubs, working as hard as if
his day's pittance were yet to earn by the literal sweat of his
brow.</p>
<p id="id03067">In this sign I read a ruffled mood. He would dig
thus in frozen snow on the coldest winter day, when urged inwardly
by painful emotion, whether of nervous excitation, or, sad thoughts
of self-reproach. He would dig by the hour, with knit brow and set
teeth, nor once lift his head, or open his lips.</p>
<p id="id03068">Sylvie watched till she was tired. Again scampering
devious, bounding here, rushing there, snuffing and sniffing
everywhere; she at last discovered me in classe. Instantly she flew
barking at the panes, as if to urge me forth to share her pleasure
or her master's toil; she had seen me occasionally walking in that
alley with M. Paul; and I doubt not, considered it my duty to join
him now, wet as it was.</p>
<p id="id03069">She made such a bustle that M. Paul at last looked
up, and of course perceived why, and at whom she barked. He
whistled to call her off; she only barked the louder. She seemed
quite bent upon having the glass door opened. Tired, I suppose,
with her importunity, he threw down his spade, approached, and
pushed the door ajar. Sylvie burst in all impetuous, sprang to my
lap, and with her paws at my neck, and her little nose and tongue
somewhat overpoweringly busy about my face, mouth, and eyes,
flourished her bushy tail over the desk, and scattered books and
papers far and wide.</p>
<p id="id03070">M. Emanuel advanced to still the clamour and repair
the disarrangement. Having gathered up the books, he captured
Sylvie, and stowed her away under his palet&Atilde;&acute;t, where
she nestled as quiet as a mouse, her head just peeping forth. She
was very tiny, and had the prettiest little innocent face, the
silkiest long ears, the finest dark eyes in the world. I never saw
her, but I thought of Paulina de Bassompierre: forgive the
association, reader, it <i>would</i> occur.</p>
<p id="id03071">M. Paul petted and patted her; the endearments she
received were not to be wondered at; she invited affection by her
beauty and her vivacious life.</p>
<p id="id03072">While caressing the spaniel, his eye roved over the
papers and books just replaced; it settled on the religious tract.
His lips moved; he half checked the impulse to speak. What! had he
promised never to address me more? If so, his better nature
pronounced the vow "more honoured in the breach than in the
observance," for with a second effort, he
spoke.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"You have not yet read the brochure, I
presume? It is not sufficiently inviting?"</p>
<p id="id03073">I replied that I had read it.</p>
<p id="id03074">He waited, as if wishing me to give an opinion upon
it unasked. Unasked, however, I was in no mood to do or say
anything. If any concessions were to be made&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;if
any advances were demanded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that was the affair
of the very docile pupil of P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas, not mine. His
eye settled upon me gently: there was mildness at the moment in its
blue ray&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there was
solicitude&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a shade of pathos; there were
meanings composite and contrasted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;reproach
melting into remorse. At the moment probably, he would have been
glad to see something emotional in me. I could not show it. In
another minute, however, I should have betrayed confusion, had I
not bethought myself to take some quill-pens from my desk, and
begin soberly to mend them.</p>
<p id="id03075">I knew that action would give a turn to his mood.
He never liked to see me mend pens; my knife was always
dull-edged&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my hand, too, was unskilful; I hacked
and chipped. On this occasion I cut my own
finger&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;half on purpose. I wanted to restore him
to his natural state, to set him at his ease, to get him to
chide.</p>
<p id="id03076">"Maladroit!" he cried at last, "she will make
mincemeat of her hands."</p>
<p id="id03077">He put Sylvie down, making her lie quiet beside his
bonnet-grec, and, depriving me of the pens and penknife, proceeded
to slice, nib, and point with the accuracy and celerity of a
machine.</p>
<p id="id03078">"Did I like the little book?" he now inquired.</p>
<p id="id03079">Suppressing a yawn, I said I hardly knew.</p>
<p id="id03080">"Had it moved me?"</p>
<p id="id03081">"I thought it had made me a little sleepy."</p>
<p id="id03082">(After a pause:) "Allons donc! It was of no use
taking that tone with him. Bad as I was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and he
should be sorry to have to name all my faults at a
breath&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;God and nature had given me 'trop de
sensibilit&Atilde;&copy; et de sympathie' not to be profoundly
affected by an appeal so touching."</p>
<p id="id03083">"Indeed!" I responded, rousing myself quickly, "I
was not affected at all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not a whit."</p>
<p id="id03084">And in proof, I drew from my pocket a perfectly dry
handkerchief, still clean and in its folds.</p>
<p id="id03085">Hereupon I was made the object of a string of
strictures rather piquant than polite. I listened with zest. After
those two days of unnatural silence, it was better than music to
hear M. Paul haranguing again just in his old fashion. I listened,
and meantime solaced myself and Sylvie with the contents of a
bonbonni&Atilde;&uml;re, which M. Emanuel's gifts kept well
supplied with chocolate comfits: It pleased him to see even a small
matter from his hand duly appreciated. He looked at me and the
spaniel while we shared the spoil; he put up his penknife. Touching
my hand with the bundle of new-cut quills, he
said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Dites donc, petite
soeur&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;speak frankly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what have
you thought of me during the last two days?"</p>
<p id="id03086">But of this question I would take no manner of
notice; its purport made my eyes fill. I caressed Sylvie
assiduously. M. Paul, leaning&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;over the desk,
bent towards me:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I called myself your brother,"
he said: "I hardly know what I
am&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;brother&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;friend&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
cannot tell. I know I think of you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I feel I
wish, you well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but I must check myself; you are
to be feared. My best friends point out danger, and whisper
caution."</p>
<p id="id03087">"You do right to listen to your friends. By all
means be cautious."</p>
<p id="id03088">"It is your religion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;your
strange, self-reliant, invulnerable creed, whose influence seems to
clothe you in, I know not what, unblessed panoply. You are
good&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas calls you good, and
loves you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but your terrible, proud, earnest
Protestantism, there is the danger. It expresses itself by your eye
at times; and again, it gives you certain tones and certain
gestures that make my flesh creep. You are not demonstrative, and
yet, just now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when you handled that
tract&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my God! I thought Lucifer smiled."</p>
<p id="id03089">"Certainly I don't respect that
tract&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what then?"</p>
<p id="id03090">"Not respect that tract? But it is the pure essence
of faith, love, charity! I thought it would touch you: in its
gentleness, I trusted that it could not fail. I laid it in your
desk with a prayer: I must indeed be a sinner: Heaven will not hear
the petitions that come warmest from my heart. You scorn my little
offering. Oh, cela me fait mal!"</p>
<p id="id03091">"Monsieur, I don't scorn it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at
least, not as your gift. Monsieur, sit down; listen to me. I am not
a heathen, I am not hard-hearted, I am not unchristian, I am not
dangerous, as they tell you; I would not trouble your faith; you
believe in God and Christ and the Bible, and so do I."</p>
<p id="id03092">"But <i>do</i> you believe in the Bible? Do you
receive Revelation? What limits are there to the wild, careless
daring of your country and sect. P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas dropped
dark hints."</p>
<p id="id03093">By dint of persuasion, I made him half-define these
hints; they amounted to crafty Jesuit-slanders. That night M. Paul
and I talked seriously and closely. He pleaded, he argued. <i>I</i>
could not argue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a fortunate incapacity; it
needed but triumphant, logical opposition to effect all the
director wished to be effected; but I could talk in my own
way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the way M. Paul was used
to&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and of which he could follow the meanderings
and fill the hiatus, and pardon the strange stammerings, strange to
him no longer. At ease with him, I could defend my creed and faith
in my own fashion; in some degree I could lull his prejudices. He
was not satisfied when he went away, hardly was he appeased; but he
was made thoroughly to feel that Protestants were not necessarily
the irreverent Pagans his director had insinuated; he was made to
comprehend something of their mode of honouring the Light, the
Life, the Word; he was enabled partly to perceive that, while their
veneration for things venerable was not quite like that cultivated
in his Church, it had its own, perhaps, deeper
power&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;its own more solemn awe.</p>
<p id="id03094">I found that P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas (himself, I
must repeat, not a bad man, though the advocate of a bad cause) had
darkly stigmatized Protestants in general, and myself by inference,
with strange names, had ascribed to us strange "isms;" Monsieur
Emanuel revealed all this in his frank fashion, which knew not
secretiveness, looking at me as he spoke with a kind, earnest fear,
almost trembling lest there should be truth in the charges.
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas, it seems, had closely watched me, had
ascertained that I went by turns, and indiscriminately, to the
three Protestant Chapels of Villette&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the French,
German, and English&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>id est</i>, the
Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopalian. Such liberality argued in the
father's eyes profound indifference&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who
tolerates all, he reasoned, can be attached to none. Now, it
happened that I had often secretly wondered at the minute and
unimportant character of the differences between these three
sects&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at the unity and identity of their vital
doctrines: I saw nothing to hinder them from being one day fused
into one grand Holy Alliance, and I respected them all, though I
thought that in each there were faults of form, incumbrances, and
trivialities. Just what I thought, that did I tell M. Emanuel, and
explained to him that my own last appeal, the guide to which I
looked, and the teacher which I owned, must always be the Bible
itself, rather than any sect, of whatever name or nation.</p>
<p id="id03095">He left me soothed, yet full of solicitude,
breathing a wish, as strong as a prayer, that if I were wrong,
Heaven would lead me right. I heard, poured forth on the threshold,
some fervid murmurings to "Marie, Reine du Ciel," some deep
aspiration that <i>his</i> hope might yet be <i>mine</i>.</p>
<p id="id03096">Strange! I had no such feverish wish to turn him
from the faith of his fathers. I thought Romanism wrong, a great
mixed image of gold and clay; but it seemed to me that <i>this</i>
Romanist held the purer elements of his creed with an innocency of
heart which God must love.</p>
<p id="id03097">The preceding conversation passed between eight and
nine o'clock of the evening, in a schoolroom of the quiet Rue
Fossette, opening on a sequestered garden. Probably about the same,
or a somewhat later hour of the succeeding evening, its echoes,
collected by holy obedience, were breathed verbatim in an attent
ear, at the panel of a confessional, in the hoary church of the
Magi. It ensued that P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas paid a visit to Madame
Beck, and stirred by I know not what mixture of motives, persuaded
her to let him undertake for a time the Englishwoman's spiritual
direction.</p>
<p id="id03098">Hereupon I was put through a course of
reading&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is, I just glanced at the books
lent me; they were too little in my way to be thoroughly read,
marked, learned, or inwardly digested. And besides, I had a book
up-stairs, under my pillow, whereof certain chapters satisfied my
needs in the article of spiritual lore, furnishing such precept and
example as, to my heart's core, I was convinced could not be
improved on.</p>
<p id="id03099">Then P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas showed me the fair side
of Rome, her good works; and bade me judge the tree by its
fruits.</p>
<p id="id03100">In answer, I felt and I avowed that these works
were <i>not</i> the fruits of Rome; they were but her abundant
blossoming, but the fair promise she showed the world, That bloom,
when set, savoured not of charity; the apple full formed was
ignorance, abasement, and bigotry. Out of men's afflictions and
affections were forged the rivets of their servitude. Poverty was
fed and clothed, and sheltered, to bind it by obligation to "the
Church;" orphanage was reared and educated that it might grow up in
the fold of "the Church;" sickness was tended that it might die
after the formula and in the ordinance of "the Church;" and men
were overwrought, and women most murderously sacrificed, and all
laid down a world God made pleasant for his creatures' good, and
took up a cross, monstrous in its galling weight, that they might
serve Rome, prove her sanctity, confirm her power, and spread the
reign of her tyrant "Church."</p>
<p id="id03101">For man's good was little done; for God's glory,
less. A thousand ways were opened with pain, with blood-sweats,
with lavishing of life; mountains were cloven through their
breasts, and rocks were split to their base; and all for what? That
a Priesthood might march straight on and straight upward to an
all-dominating eminence, whence they might at last stretch the
sceptre of their Moloch "Church."</p>
<p id="id03102">It will not be. God is not with Rome, and, were
human sorrows still for the Son of God, would he not mourn over her
cruelties and ambitions, as once he mourned over the crimes and
woes of doomed Jerusalem!</p>
<p id="id03103">Oh, lovers of power! Oh, mitred aspirants for this
world's kingdoms! an hour will come, even to you, when it will be
well for your hearts&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pausing faint at each
broken beat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that there is a Mercy beyond human
compassions, a Love, stronger than this strong death which even you
must face, and before it, fall; a Charity more potent than any sin,
even yours; a Pity which redeems worlds&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nay,
absolves Priests.</p>
<p id="id03104">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03105">My third temptation was held out in the pomp of
Rome&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the glory of her kingdom. I was taken to
the churches on solemn occasions&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;days of
f&Atilde;&ordf;te and state; I was shown the Papal ritual and
ceremonial. I looked at it.</p>
<p id="id03106">Many people&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;men and
women&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no doubt far my superiors in a thousand
ways, have felt this display impressive, have declared that though
their Reason protested, their Imagination was subjugated. I cannot
say the same. Neither full procession, nor high mass, nor swarming
tapers, nor swinging censers, nor ecclesiastical millinery, nor
celestial jewellery, touched my imagination a whit. What I saw
struck me as tawdry, not grand; as grossly material, not poetically
spiritual.</p>
<p id="id03107">This I did not tell P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas; he was
old, he looked venerable: through every abortive experiment, under
every repeated disappointment, he remained personally kind to me,
and I felt tender of hurting his feelings. But on the evening of a
certain day when, from the balcony of a great house, I had been
made to witness a huge mingled procession of the church and the
army&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;priests with relics, and soldiers with
weapons, an obese and aged archbishop, habited in cambric and lace,
looking strangely like a grey daw in bird-of-paradise plumage, and
a band of young girls fantastically robed and
garlanded&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>then</i> I spoke my mind to M.
Paul.</p>
<p id="id03108">"I did not like it," I told him; "I did not respect
such ceremonies; I wished to see no more."</p>
<p id="id03109">And having relieved my conscience by this
declaration, I was able to go on, and, speaking more currently and
clearly than my wont, to show him that I had a mind to keep to my
reformed creed; the more I saw of Popery the closer I clung to
Protestantism; doubtless there were errors in every church, but I
now perceived by contrast how severely pure was my own, compared
with her whose painted and meretricious face had been unveiled for
my admiration. I told him how we kept fewer forms between us and
God; retaining, indeed, no more than, perhaps, the nature of
mankind in the mass rendered necessary for due observance. I told
him I could not look on flowers and tinsel, on wax-lights and
embroidery, at such times and under such circumstances as should be
devoted to lifting the secret vision to Him whose home is Infinity,
and His being&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Eternity. That when I thought of
sin and sorrow, of earthly corruption, mortal depravity, weighty
temporal woe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I could not care for chanting
priests or mumming officials; that when the pains of existence and
the terrors of dissolution pressed before
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;when the mighty hope and measureless doubt of
the future arose in view&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>then</i>, even the
scientific strain, or the prayer in a language learned and dead,
harassed: with hindrance a heart which only longed to
cry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"God be merciful to me, a sinner!"</p>
<p id="id03110">When I had so spoken, so declared my faith, and so
widely severed myself, from him I
addressed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;then, at last, came a tone accordant,
an echo responsive, one sweet chord of harmony in two conflicting
spirits.</p>
<p id="id03111">"Whatever say priests or controversialists,"
murmured M. Emanuel, "God is good, and loves all the sincere.
Believe, then, what you can; believe it as you can; one prayer, at
least, we have in common; I also cry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;'O Dieu,
sois appais&Atilde;&copy; envers moi qui suis
p&Atilde;&copy;cheur!'"</p>
<p id="id03112">He leaned on the back of my chair. After some
thought he again spoke:</p>
<p id="id03113">"How seem in the eyes of that God who made all
firmaments, from whose nostrils issued whatever of life is here, or
in the stars shining yonder&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how seem the
differences of man? But as Time is not for God, nor Space, so
neither is Measure, nor Comparison. We abase ourselves in our
littleness, and we do right; yet it may be that the constancy of
one heart, the truth and faith of one mind according to the light
He has appointed, import as much to Him as the just motion of
satellites about their planets, of planets about their suns, of
suns around that mighty unseen centre incomprehensible,
irrealizable, with strange mental effort only divined.</p>
<p id="id03114">"God guide us all! God bless you, Lucy!"</p>
<h2 id="id03115" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<h5 id="id03116">SUNSHINE.</h5>
<p id="id03117" style="margin-top: 2em">It was very, well for
Paulina to decline further correspondence with Graham till her
father had sanctioned the intercourse. But Dr. Bretton could not
live within a league of the H&Atilde;&acute;tel Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy,
and not contrive to visit there often. Both lovers meant at first,
I believe, to be distant; they kept their intention so far as
demonstrative courtship went, but in feeling they soon drew very
near.</p>
<p id="id03118">All that was best in Graham sought Paulina;
whatever in him was noble, awoke, and grew in her presence. With
his past admiration of Miss Fanshawe, I suppose his intellect had
little to do, but his whole intellect, and his highest tastes, came
in question now. These, like all his faculties, were active, eager
for nutriment, and alive to gratification when it came.</p>
<p id="id03119">I cannot say that Paulina designedly led him to
talk of books, or formally proposed to herself for a moment the
task of winning him to reflection, or planned the improvement of
his mind, or so much as fancied his mind could in any one respect
be improved. She thought him very perfect; it was Graham himself,
who, at first by the merest chance, mentioned some book he had been
reading, and when in her response sounded a welcome harmony of
sympathies, something, pleasant to his soul, he talked on, more and
better perhaps than he had ever talked before on such subjects. She
listened with delight, and answered with animation. In each
successive answer, Graham heard a music waxing finer and finer to
his sense; in each he found a suggestive, persuasive, magic accent
that opened a scarce-known treasure-house within, showed him
unsuspected power in his own mind, and what was better, latent
goodness in his heart. Each liked the way in which the other
talked; the voice, the diction, the expression pleased; each keenly
relished the flavour of the other's wit; they met each other's
meaning with strange quickness, their thoughts often matched like
carefully-chosen pearls. Graham had wealth of mirth by nature;
Paulina possessed no such inherent flow of animal
spirits&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;unstimulated, she inclined to be
thoughtful and pensive&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but now she seemed merry
as a lark; in her lover's genial presence, she glanced like some
soft glad light. How beautiful she grew in her happiness, I can
hardly express, but I wondered to see her. As to that gentle ice of
hers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that reserve on which she had depended;
where was it now? Ah! Graham would not long bear it; he brought
with him a generous influence that soon thawed the timid,
self-imposed restriction.</p>
<p id="id03120">Now were the old Bretton days talked over; perhaps
brokenly at first, with a sort of smiling diffidence, then with
opening candour and still growing confidence. Graham had made for
himself a better opportunity than that he had wished me to give; he
had earned independence of the collateral help that disobliging
Lucy had refused; all his reminiscences of "little Polly" found
their proper expression in his own pleasant tones, by his own kind
and handsome lips; how much better than if suggested by me.</p>
<p id="id03121">More than once when we were alone, Paulina would
tell me how wonderful and curious it was to discover the richness
and accuracy of his memory in this matter. How, while he was
looking at her, recollections would seem to be suddenly quickened
in his mind. He reminded her that she had once gathered his head in
her arms, caressed his leonine graces, and cried out, "Graham, I
<i>do</i> like you!" He told her how she would set a footstool
beside him, and climb by its aid to his knee. At this day he said
he could recall the sensation of her little hands smoothing his
cheek, or burying themselves in his thick mane. He remembered the
touch of her small forefinger, placed half tremblingly, half
curiously, in the cleft in his chin, the lisp, the look with which
she would name it "a pretty dimple," then seek his eyes and
question why they pierced so, telling him he had a "nice, strange
face; far nicer, far stranger, than either his mamma or Lucy
Snowe."</p>
<p id="id03122">"Child as I was," remarked Paulina, "I wonder how I
dared be so venturous. To me he seems now all sacred, his locks are
inaccessible, and, Lucy, I feel a sort of fear, when I look at his
firm, marble chin, at his straight Greek features. Women are called
beautiful, Lucy; he is not like a woman, therefore I suppose he is
not beautiful, but what is he, then? Do other people see him with
my eyes? Do <i>you</i> admire him?"</p>
<p id="id03123">"I'll tell you what I do, Paulina," was once my
answer to her many questions. "<i>I never see him</i>. I looked at
him twice or thrice about a year ago, before he recognised me, and
then I shut my eyes; and if he were to cross their balls twelve
times between each day's sunset and sunrise, except from memory, I
should hardly know what shape had gone by."</p>
<p id="id03124">"Lucy, what do you mean?" said she, under her
breath.</p>
<p id="id03125">"I mean that I value vision, and dread being struck
stone blind."</p>
<p id="id03126">It was best to answer her strongly at once, and to
silence for ever the tender, passionate confidences which left her
lips sweet honey, and sometimes dropped in my
ear&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;molten lead. To me, she commented no more on
her lover's beauty.</p>
<p id="id03127">Yet speak of him she would; sometimes shyly, in
quiet, brief phrases; sometimes with a tenderness of cadence, and
music of voice exquisite in itself; but which chafed me at times
miserably; and then, I know, I gave her stern looks and words; but
cloudless happiness had dazzled her native clear sight, and she
only thought Lucy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fitful.</p>
<p id="id03128">"Spartan girl! Proud Lucy!" she would say, smiling
at me. "Graham says you are the most peculiar, capricious little
woman he knows; but yet you are excellent; we both think so."</p>
<p id="id03129">"You both think you know not what," said I. "Have
the goodness to make me as little the subject of your mutual talk
and thoughts as possible. I have my sort of life apart from
yours."</p>
<p id="id03130">"But ours, Lucy, is a beautiful life, or it will
be; and you shall share it."</p>
<p id="id03131">"I shall share no man's or woman's life in this
world, as you understand sharing. I think I have one friend of my
own, but am not sure; and till I <i>am</i> sure, I live
solitary."</p>
<p id="id03132">"But solitude is sadness."</p>
<p id="id03133">"Yes; it is sadness. Life, however; has worse than
that. Deeper than melancholy, lies heart-break."</p>
<p id="id03134">"Lucy, I wonder if anybody will ever comprehend you
altogether."</p>
<p id="id03135">There is, in lovers, a certain infatuation of
egotism; they will have a witness of their happiness, cost that
witness what it may. Paulina had forbidden letters, yet Dr. Bretton
wrote; she had resolved against correspondence, yet she answered,
were it only to chide. She showed me these letters; with something
of the spoiled child's wilfulness, and of the heiress's
imperiousness, she <i>made</i> me read them. As I read Graham's, I
scarce wondered at her exaction, and understood her pride: they
were fine letters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;manly and
fond&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;modest and gallant. Hers must have appeared
to him beautiful. They had not been written to show her talents;
still less, I think, to express her love. On the contrary, it
appeared that she had proposed to herself the task of hiding that
feeling, and bridling her lover's ardour. But how could such
letters serve such a purpose? Graham was become dear as her life;
he drew her like a powerful magnet. For her there was influence
unspeakable in all he uttered, wrote, thought, or looked. With this
unconfessed confession, her letters glowed; it kindled them, from
greeting to adieu.</p>
<p id="id03136">"I wish papa knew; I <i>do</i> wish papa knew!"
began now to be her anxious murmur. "I wish, and yet I fear. I can
hardly keep Graham back from telling him. There is nothing I long
for more than to have this affair settled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to
speak out candidly; and yet I dread the crisis. I know, I am
certain, papa will be angry at the first; I fear he will dislike me
almost; it will seem to him an untoward business; it will be a
surprise, a shock: I can hardly foresee its whole effect on
him."</p>
<p id="id03137">The fact was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her father, long
calm, was beginning to be a little stirred: long blind on one
point, an importunate light was beginning to trespass on his
eye.</p>
<p id="id03138">To <i>her</i>, he said nothing; but when she was
not looking at, or perhaps thinking of him, I saw him gaze and
meditate on her.</p>
<p id="id03139">One evening&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Paulina was in her
dressing-room, writing, I believe, to Graham; she had left me in
the library, reading&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;M. de Bassompierre came in;
he sat down: I was about to withdraw; he requested me to
remain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gently, yet in a manner which showed he
wished compliance. He had taken his seat near the window, at a
distance from me; he opened a desk; he took from it what looked
like a memorandum-book; of this book he studied a certain entry for
several minutes.</p>
<p id="id03140">"Miss Snowe," said he, laying it down, "do you know
my little girl's age?"</p>
<p id="id03141">"About eighteen, is it not, sir?"</p>
<p id="id03142">"It seems so. This old pocket-book tells me she was
born on the 5th of May, in the year 18&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;,
eighteen years ago. It is strange; I had lost the just reckoning of
her age. I thought of her as
twelve&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fourteen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an indefinite
date; but she seemed a child."</p>
<p id="id03143">"She is about eighteen," I repeated. "She is grown
up; she will be no taller."</p>
<p id="id03144">"My little jewel!" said M. de Bassompierre, in a
tone which penetrated like some of his daughter's accents.</p>
<p id="id03145">He sat very thoughtful.</p>
<p id="id03146">"Sir, don't grieve," I said; for I knew his
feelings, utterly unspoken as they were.</p>
<p id="id03147">"She is the only pearl I have," he said; "and now
others will find out that she is pure and of price: they will covet
her."</p>
<p id="id03148">I made no answer. Graham Bretton had dined with us
that day; he had shone both in converse and looks: I know not what
pride of bloom embellished his aspect and mellowed his intercourse.
Under the stimulus of a high hope, something had unfolded in his
whole manner which compelled attention. I think he had purposed on
that day to indicate the origin of his endeavours, and the aim of
his ambition. M. de Bassompierre had found himself forced, in a
manner, to descry the direction and catch the character of his
homage. Slow in remarking, he was logical in reasoning: having once
seized the thread, it had guided him through a long labyrinth.</p>
<p id="id03149">"Where is she?" he asked.</p>
<p id="id03150">"She is up-stairs."</p>
<p id="id03151">"What is she doing?"</p>
<p id="id03152">"She is writing."</p>
<p id="id03153">"She writes, does she? Does she receive
letters?"</p>
<p id="id03154">"None but such as she can show me.
And&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sir&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>they</i>
have long wanted to consult you."</p>
<p id="id03155">"Pshaw! They don't think of
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an old father! I am in the way."</p>
<p id="id03156">"Ah, M. de Bassompierre&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not
so&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that can't be! But Paulina must speak for
herself: and Dr. Bretton, too, must be his own advocate."</p>
<p id="id03157">"It is a little late. Matters are advanced, it
seems."</p>
<p id="id03158">"Sir, till you approve, nothing is
done&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;only they love each other."</p>
<p id="id03159">"Only!" he echoed.</p>
<p id="id03160">Invested by fate with the part of confidante and
mediator, I was obliged to go on: "Hundreds of times has Dr.
Bretton been on the point of appealing to you, sir; but, with all
his high courage, he fears you mortally."</p>
<p id="id03161">"He may well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he may well fear
me. He has touched the best thing I have. Had he but let her alone,
she would have remained a child for years yet. So. Are they
engaged?"</p>
<p id="id03162">"They could not become engaged without your
permission."</p>
<p id="id03163">"It is well for you, Miss Snowe, to talk and think
with that propriety which always characterizes you; but this matter
is a grief to me; my little girl was all I had: I have no more
daughters and no son; Bretton might as well have looked elsewhere;
there are scores of rich and pretty women who would not, I daresay,
dislike him: he has looks, and conduct, and connection. Would
nothing serve him but my Polly?"</p>
<p id="id03164">"If he had never seen your 'Polly,' others might
and would have pleased him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;your niece, Miss
Fanshawe, for instance."</p>
<p id="id03165">"Ah! I would have given him Ginevra with all my
heart; but Polly!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I can't let him have her.
No&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I can't. He is not her equal," he affirmed,
rather gruffly. "In what particular is he her match? They talk of
fortune! I am not an avaricious or interested man, but the world
thinks of these things&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and Polly will be
rich."</p>
<p id="id03166">"Yes, that is known," said I: "all Villette knows
her as an heiress."</p>
<p id="id03167">"Do they talk of my little girl in that light?"</p>
<p id="id03168">"They do, sir."</p>
<p id="id03169">He fell into deep thought. I ventured to say,
"Would you, sir, think any one Paulina's match? Would you prefer
any other to Dr. Bretton? Do you think higher rank or more wealth
would make much difference in your feelings towards a future
son-in-law?"</p>
<p id="id03170">"You touch me there," said he.</p>
<p id="id03171">"Look at the aristocracy of
Villette&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you would not like them, sir?"</p>
<p id="id03172">"I should not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;never a duc,
baron, or vicomte of the lot."</p>
<p id="id03173">"I am told many of these persons think about her,
sir," I went on, gaining courage on finding that I met attention
rather than repulse. "Other suitors will come, therefore, if Dr.
Bretton is refused. Wherever you go, I suppose, aspirants will not
be wanting. Independent of heiress-ship, it appears to me that
Paulina charms most of those who see her."</p>
<p id="id03174">"Does she? How? My little girl is not thought a
beauty."</p>
<p id="id03175">"Sir, Miss de Bassompierre is very beautiful."</p>
<p id="id03176">"Nonsense!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;begging your pardon,
Miss Snowe, but I think you are too partial. I like Polly: I like
all her ways and all her looks&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but then I am her
father; and even I never thought about beauty. She is amusing,
fairy-like, interesting to me;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you must be
mistaken in supposing her handsome?"</p>
<p id="id03177">"She attracts, sir: she would attract without the
advantages of your wealth and position."</p>
<p id="id03178">"My wealth and position! Are these any bait to
Graham? If I thought
so&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id03179">"Dr. Bretton knows these points perfectly, as you
may be sure, M. de Bassompierre, and values them as any gentleman
would&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as <i>you</i> would yourself, under the
same circumstances&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but they are not his baits.
He loves your daughter very much; he feels her finest qualities,
and they influence him worthily."</p>
<p id="id03180">"What! has my little pet 'fine qualities?'"</p>
<p id="id03181">"Ah, sir! did you observe her that evening when so
many men of eminence and learning dined here?"</p>
<p id="id03182">"I certainly was rather struck and surprised with
her manner that day; its womanliness made me smile."</p>
<p id="id03183">"And did you see those accomplished Frenchmen
gather round her in the drawing-room?"</p>
<p id="id03184">"I did; but I thought it was by way of
relaxation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as one might amuse one's self with a
pretty infant."</p>
<p id="id03185">"Sir, she demeaned herself with distinction; and I
heard the French gentlemen say she was 'p&Atilde;&copy;trie
d'esprit et de graces.' Dr. Bretton thought the same."</p>
<p id="id03186">"She is a good, dear child, that is certain; and I
<i>do</i> believe she has some character. When I think of it, I was
once ill; Polly nursed me; they thought I should die; she, I
recollect, grew at once stronger and tenderer as I grew worse in
health. And as I recovered, what a sunbeam she was in my sick-room!
Yes; she played about my chair as noiselessly and as cheerful as
light. And now she is sought in marriage! I don't want to part with
her," said he, and he groaned.</p>
<p id="id03187">"You have known Dr. and Mrs. Bretton so long," I
suggested, "it would be less like separation to give her to him
than to another."</p>
<p id="id03188">He reflected rather gloomily.</p>
<p id="id03189">"True. I have long known Louisa Bretton," he
murmured. "She and I are indeed old, old friends; a sweet, kind
girl she was when she was young. You talk of beauty, Miss Snowe!
<i>she</i> was handsome, if you will&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;tall,
straight, and blooming&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not the mere child or elf
my Polly seems to me: at eighteen, Louisa had a carriage and
stature fit for a princess. She is a comely and a good woman now.
The lad is like her; I have always thought so, and favoured and
wished him well. Now he repays me by this robbery! My little
treasure used to love her old father dearly and truly. It is all
over now, doubtless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am an incumbrance."</p>
<p id="id03190">The door opened&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his "little
treasure" came in. She was dressed, so to speak, in evening beauty;
that animation which sometimes comes with the close of day, warmed
her eye and cheek; a tinge of summer crimson heightened her
complexion; her curls fell full and long on her lily neck; her
white dress suited the heat of June. Thinking me alone, she had
brought in her hand the letter just
written&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;brought it folded but unsealed. I was to
read it. When she saw her father, her tripping step faltered a
little, paused a moment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the colour in her cheek
flowed rosy over her whole face.</p>
<p id="id03191">"Polly," said M. de Bassompierre, in a low voice,
with a grave smile, "do you blush at seeing papa? That is something
new."</p>
<p id="id03192">"I don't blush&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I never <i>do</i>
blush," affirmed she, while another eddy from the heart sent up its
scarlet. "But I thought you were in the dining-room, and I wanted
Lucy."</p>
<p id="id03193">"You thought I was with John Graham Bretton, I
suppose? But he has just been called out: he will be back soon,
Polly. He can post your letter for you; it will save Matthieu a
'course,' as he calls it."</p>
<p id="id03194">"I don't post letters," said she, rather
pettishly.</p>
<p id="id03195">"What do you do with them,
then?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;come here and tell me."</p>
<p id="id03196">Both her mind and gesture seemed to hesitate a
second&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to say "Shall I
come?"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but she approached.</p>
<p id="id03197">"How long is it since you became a letter-writer,
Polly? It only seems yesterday when you were at your pot-hooks,
labouring away absolutely with both hands at the pen."</p>
<p id="id03198">"Papa, they are not letters to send to the post in
your letter-bag; they are only notes, which I give now and then
into the person's hands, just to satisfy."</p>
<p id="id03199">"The person! That means Miss Snowe, I suppose?"</p>
<p id="id03200">"No, papa&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not Lucy."</p>
<p id="id03201">"Who then? Perhaps Mrs. Bretton?"</p>
<p id="id03202">"No, papa&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not Mrs. Bretton."</p>
<p id="id03203">"Who, then, my little daughter? Tell papa the
truth."</p>
<p id="id03204">"Oh, papa!" she cried with earnestness, "I
will&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I <i>will</i> tell you the
truth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all the truth; I am glad to tell
you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;glad, though I tremble."</p>
<p id="id03205">She <i>did</i> tremble: growing excitement,
kindling feeling, and also gathering courage, shook her.</p>
<p id="id03206">"I hate to hide my actions from you, papa. I fear
you and love you above everything but God. Read the letter; look at
the address."</p>
<p id="id03207">She laid it on his knee. He took it up and read it
through; his hand shaking, his eyes glistening meantime.</p>
<p id="id03208">He re-folded it, and viewed the writer with a
strange, tender, mournful amaze.</p>
<p id="id03209">"Can <i>she</i> write so&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
little thing that stood at my knee but yesterday? Can she feel
so?"</p>
<p id="id03210">"Papa, is it wrong? Does it pain you?"</p>
<p id="id03211">"There is nothing wrong in it, my innocent little
Mary; but it pains me."</p>
<p id="id03212">"But, papa, listen! You shall not be pained by me.
I would give up everything&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost" (correcting
herself); "I would die rather than make you unhappy; that would be
too wicked!"</p>
<p id="id03213">She shuddered.</p>
<p id="id03214">"Does the letter not please you? Must it not go?
Must it be torn? It shall, for your sake, if you order it."</p>
<p id="id03215">"I order nothing."</p>
<p id="id03216">"Order something, papa; express your wish; only
don't hurt, don't grieve Graham. I cannot, <i>cannot</i> bear that.
I love you, papa; but I love Graham
too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;because&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;because&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it
is impossible to help it."</p>
<p id="id03217">"This splendid Graham is a young scamp,
Polly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that is my present notion of him: it will
surprise you to hear that, for my part, I do not love him one whit.
Ah! years ago I saw something in that lad's eye I never quite
fathomed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something his mother has
not&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a depth which warned a man not to wade into
that stream too far; now, suddenly, I find myself taken over the
crown of the head."</p>
<p id="id03218">"Papa, you don't&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;you have not
fallen in; you are safe on the bank; you can do as you please; your
power is despotic; you can shut me up in a convent, and break
Graham's heart to-morrow, if you choose to be so cruel. Now,
autocrat, now czar, will you do this?"</p>
<p id="id03219">"Off with him to Siberia, red whiskers and all; I
say, I don't like him, Polly, and I wonder that you should."</p>
<p id="id03220">"Papa," said she, "do you know you are very
naughty? I never saw you look so disagreeable, so unjust, so almost
vindictive before. There is an expression in your face which does
not belong to you."</p>
<p id="id03221">"Off with him!" pursued Mr. Home, who certainly did
look sorely crossed and annoyed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even a little
bitter; "but, I suppose, if he went, Polly would pack a bundle and
run after him; her heart is fairly won&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;won, and
weaned from her old father."</p>
<p id="id03222">"Papa, I say it is naughty, it is decidedly wrong,
to talk in that way. I am <i>not</i> weaned from you, and no human
being and no mortal influence <i>can</i> wean me."</p>
<p id="id03223">"Be married, Polly! Espouse the red whiskers. Cease
to be a daughter; go and be a wife!"</p>
<p id="id03224">"Red whiskers! I wonder what you mean, papa. You
should take care of prejudice. You sometimes say to me that all the
Scotch, your countrymen, are the victims of prejudice. It is proved
now, I think, when no distinction is to be made between red and
deep nut-brown."</p>
<p id="id03225">"Leave the prejudiced old Scotchman; go away."</p>
<p id="id03226">She stood looking at him a minute. She wanted to
show firmness, superiority to taunts; knowing her father's
character, guessing his few foibles, she had expected the sort of
scene which was now transpiring; it did not take her by surprise,
and she desired to let it pass with dignity, reliant upon reaction.
Her dignity stood her in no stead. Suddenly her soul melted in her
eyes; she fell on his neck:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I won't leave you,
papa; I'll never leave you. I won't pain you! I'll never pain you!"
was her cry.</p>
<p id="id03227">"My lamb! my treasure!" murmured the loving though
rugged sire. He said no more for the moment; indeed, those two
words were hoarse.</p>
<p id="id03228">The room was now darkening. I heard a movement, a
step without. Thinking it might be a servant coming with candles, I
gently opened, to prevent intrusion. In the ante-room stood no
servant: a tall gentleman was placing his hat on the table, drawing
off his gloves slowly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;lingering, waiting, it
seemed to me. He called me neither by sign nor word; yet his eye
said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Lucy, come here." And I went.</p>
<p id="id03229">Over his face a smile flowed, while he looked down
on me: no temper, save his own, would have expressed by a smile the
sort of agitation which now fevered him.</p>
<p id="id03230">"M. de Bassompierre is there&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is
he not?" he inquired, pointing to the library.</p>
<p id="id03231">"Yes."</p>
<p id="id03232">"He noticed me at dinner? He understood me?"</p>
<p id="id03233">"Yes, Graham."</p>
<p id="id03234">"I am brought up for judgment, then, and so is
<i>she</i>?"</p>
<p id="id03235">"Mr. Home" (we now and always continued to term him
Mr. Home at times) "is talking to his daughter."</p>
<p id="id03236">"Ha! These are sharp moments, Lucy!"</p>
<p id="id03237">He was quite stirred up; his young hand trembled; a
vital (I was going to write <i>mortal</i>, but such words ill apply
to one all living like him)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a vital suspense now
held, now hurried, his breath: in all this trouble his smile never
faded.</p>
<p id="id03238">"Is he <i>very</i> angry, Lucy?"</p>
<p id="id03239">"<i>She</i> is very faithful, Graham."</p>
<p id="id03240">"What will be done unto me?"</p>
<p id="id03241">"Graham, your star must be fortunate."</p>
<p id="id03242">"Must it? Kind prophet! So cheered, I should be a
faint heart indeed to quail. I think I find all women faithful,
Lucy. I ought to love them, and I do. My mother is good; <i>she</i>
is divine; and <i>you</i> are true as steel. Are you not?"</p>
<p id="id03243">"Yes, Graham."</p>
<p id="id03244">"Then give me thy hand, my little god-sister: it is
a friendly little hand to me, and always has been. And now for the
great venture. God be with the right. Lucy, say Amen!"</p>
<p id="id03245">He turned, and waited till I said
"Amen!"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which I did to please him: the old
charm, in doing as he bid me, came back. I wished him success; and
successful I knew he would be. He was born victor, as some are born
vanquished.</p>
<p id="id03246">"Follow me!" he said; and I followed him into Mr.
Home's presence.</p>
<p id="id03247">"Sir," he asked, "what is my sentence?"</p>
<p id="id03248">The father looked at him: the daughter kept her
face hid.</p>
<p id="id03249">"Well, Bretton," said Mr. Home, "you have given me
the usual reward of hospitality. I entertained you; you have taken
my best. I was always glad to see you; you were glad to see the one
precious thing I had. You spoke me fair; and, meantime, I will not
say you <i>robbed</i> me, but I am bereaved, and what I have lost,
<i>you</i>, it seems, have won."</p>
<p id="id03250">"Sir, I cannot repent."</p>
<p id="id03251">"Repent! Not you! You triumph, no doubt: John
Graham, you descended partly from a Highlander and a chief, and
there is a trace of the Celt in all you look, speak, and think. You
have his cunning and his charm. The red&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;(Well
then, Polly, the <i>fair</i>) hair, the tongue of guile, and brain
of wile, are all come down by inheritance."</p>
<p id="id03252">"Sir, I <i>feel</i> honest enough," said Graham;
and a genuine English blush covered his face with its warm witness
of sincerity. "And yet," he added, "I won't deny that in some
respects you accuse me justly. In your presence I have always had a
thought which I dared not show you. I did truly regard you as the
possessor of the most valuable thing the world owns for me. I
wished for it: I tried for it. Sir, I ask for it now."</p>
<p id="id03253">"John, you ask much."</p>
<p id="id03254">"Very much, sir. It must come from your generosity,
as a gift; from your justice, as a reward. I can never earn
it."</p>
<p id="id03255">"Ay! Listen to the Highland tongue!" said Mr. Home.
"Look up, Polly!<br />
Answer this 'braw wooer;' send him away!"<br /></p>
<p id="id03256">She looked up. She shyly glanced at her eager,
handsome suitor. She gazed tenderly on her furrowed sire.</p>
<p id="id03257">"Papa, I love you both," said she; "I can take care
of you both. I need not send Graham away&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he can
live here; he will be no inconvenience," she alleged with that
simplicity of phraseology which at times was wont to make both her
father and Graham smile. They smiled now.</p>
<p id="id03258">"He will be a prodigious inconvenience to me,"
still persisted Mr. Home. "I don't want him, Polly, he is too tall;
he is in my way. Tell him to march."</p>
<p id="id03259">"You will get used to him, papa. He seemed
exceedingly tall to me at first&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;like a tower
when I looked up at him; but, on the whole, I would rather not have
him otherwise."</p>
<p id="id03260">"I object to him altogether, Polly; I can do
without a son-in-law. I should never have requested the best man in
the land to stand to me in that relation. Dismiss this
gentleman."</p>
<p id="id03261">"But he has known you so long, papa, and suits you
so well."</p>
<p id="id03262">"Suits <i>me</i>, forsooth! Yes; he has pretended
to make my opinions and tastes his own. He has humoured me for good
reasons. I think, Polly, you and I will bid him good-by."</p>
<p id="id03263">"Till to-morrow only. Shake hands with Graham,
papa."</p>
<p id="id03264">"No: I think not: I am not friends with him. Don't
think to coax me between you."</p>
<p id="id03265">"Indeed, indeed, you <i>are</i> friends. Graham,
stretch out your right hand. Papa, put out yours. Now, let them
touch. Papa, don't be stiff; close your fingers; be
pliant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there! But that is not a
clasp&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is a grasp? Papa, you grasp like a
vice. You crush Graham's hand to the bone; you hurt him!"</p>
<p id="id03266">He must have hurt him; for he wore a massive ring,
set round with brilliants, of which the sharp facets cut into
Graham's flesh and drew blood: but pain only made Dr. John laugh,
as anxiety had made him smile.</p>
<p id="id03267">"Come with me into my study," at last said Mr. Home
to the doctor. They went. Their intercourse was not long, but I
suppose it was conclusive. The suitor had to undergo an
interrogatory and a scrutiny on many things. Whether Dr. Bretton
was at times guileful in look and language or not, there was a
sound foundation below. His answers, I understood afterwards,
evinced both wisdom and integrity. He had managed his affairs well.
He had struggled through entanglements; his fortunes were in the
way of retrieval; he proved himself in a position to marry.</p>
<p id="id03268">Once more the father and lover appeared in the
library. M. de<br />
Bassompierre shut the door; he pointed to his daughter.<br /></p>
<p id="id03269">"Take her," he said. "Take her, John Bretton: and
may God deal with you as you deal with her!"</p>
<p id="id03270">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03271">Not long after, perhaps a fortnight, I saw three
persons, Count de Bassompierre, his daughter, and Dr. Graham
Bretton, sitting on one seat, under a low-spreading and umbrageous
tree, in the grounds of the palace at Bois l'Etang. They had come
thither to enjoy a summer evening: outside the magnificent gates
their carriage waited to take them home; the green sweeps of turf
spread round them quiet and dim; the palace rose at a distance,
white as a crag on Pentelicus; the evening star shone above it; a
forest of flowering shrubs embalmed the climate of this spot; the
hour was still and sweet; the scene, but for this group, was
solitary.</p>
<p id="id03272">Paulina sat between the two gentlemen: while they
conversed, her little hands were busy at some work; I thought at
first she was binding a nosegay. No; with the tiny pair of
scissors, glittering in her lap, she had severed spoils from each
manly head beside her, and was now occupied in plaiting together
the grey lock and the golden wave. The plait
woven&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no silk-thread being at hand to bind
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a tress of her own hair was made to serve
that purpose; she tied it like a knot, prisoned it in a locket, and
laid it on her heart.</p>
<p id="id03273">"Now," said she, "there is an amulet made, which
has virtue to keep you two always friends. You can never quarrel so
long as I wear this."</p>
<p id="id03274">An amulet was indeed made, a spell framed which
rendered enmity impossible. She was become a bond to both, an
influence over each, a mutual concord. From them she drew her
happiness, and what she borrowed, she, with interest, gave
back.</p>
<p id="id03275">"Is there, indeed, such happiness on earth?" I
asked, as I watched the father, the daughter, the future husband,
now united&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all blessed and blessing.</p>
<p id="id03276">Yes; it is so. Without any colouring of romance, or
any exaggeration of fancy, it is so. Some real lives
do&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for some certain days or
years&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;actually anticipate the happiness of
Heaven; and, I believe, if such perfect happiness is once felt by
good people (to the wicked it never comes), its sweet effect is
never wholly lost. Whatever trials follow, whatever pains of
sickness or shades of death, the glory precedent still shines
through, cheering the keen anguish, and tinging the deep cloud.</p>
<p id="id03277">I will go farther. I <i>do</i> believe there are
some human beings so born, so reared, so guided from a soft cradle
to a calm and late grave, that no excessive suffering penetrates
their lot, and no tempestuous blackness overcasts their journey.
And often, these are not pampered, selfish beings, but Nature's
elect, harmonious and benign; men and women mild with charity, kind
agents of God's kind attributes.</p>
<p id="id03278">Let me not delay the happy truth. Graham Bretton
and Paulina de Bassompierre were married, and such an agent did Dr.
Bretton prove. He did not with time degenerate; his faults decayed,
his virtues ripened; he rose in intellectual refinement, he won in
moral profit: all dregs filtered away, the clear wine settled
bright and tranquil. Bright, too, was the destiny of his sweet
wife. She kept her husband's love, she aided in his
progress&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of his happiness she was the corner
stone.</p>
<p id="id03279">This pair was blessed indeed, for years brought
them, with great prosperity, great goodness: they imparted with
open hand, yet wisely. Doubtless they knew crosses,
disappointments, difficulties; but these were well borne. More than
once, too, they had to look on Him whose face flesh scarce can see
and live: they had to pay their tribute to the King of Terrors. In
the fulness of years, M. de Bassompierre was taken: in ripe old age
departed Louisa Bretton. Once even there rose a cry in their halls,
of Rachel weeping for her children; but others sprang healthy and
blooming to replace the lost: Dr. Bretton saw himself live again in
a son who inherited his looks and his disposition; he had stately
daughters, too, like himself: these children he reared with a
suave, yet a firm hand; they grew up according to inheritance and
nurture.</p>
<p id="id03280">In short, I do but speak the truth when I say that
these two lives of Graham and Paulina were blessed, like that of
Jacob's favoured son, with "blessings of Heaven above, blessings of
the deep that lies under." It was so, for God saw that it was
good.</p>

<h5 id="id03282">CLOUD.</h5>
<p id="id03283" style="margin-top: 2em">But it is not so for all.
What then? His will be done, as done it surely will be, whether we
humble ourselves to resignation or not. The impulse of creation
forwards it; the strength of powers, seen and unseen, has its
fulfilment in charge. Proof of a life to come must be given. In
fire and in blood, if needful, must that proof be written. In fire
and in blood do we trace the record throughout nature. In fire and
in blood does it cross our own experience. Sufferer, faint not
through terror of this burning evidence. Tired wayfarer, gird up
thy loins; look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother
mourners, join in friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of
this world stretches the way for most of us: equal and steady be
our tread; be our cross our banner. For staff we have His promise,
whose "word is tried, whose way perfect:" for present hope His
providence, "who gives the shield of salvation, whose gentleness
makes great;" for final home His bosom, who "dwells in the height
of Heaven;" for crowning prize a glory, exceeding and eternal. Let
us so run that we may obtain: let us endure hardness as good
soldiers; let us finish our course, and keep the faith, reliant in
the issue to come off more than conquerors: "Art thou not from
everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!"</p>
<p id="id03284">On a Thursday morning we were all assembled in
classe, waiting for the lesson of literature. The hour was come; we
expected the master.</p>
<p id="id03285">The pupils of the first classe sat very still; the
cleanly-written compositions prepared since the last lesson lay
ready before them, neatly tied with ribbon, waiting to be gathered
by the hand of the Professor as he made his rapid round of the
desks. The month was July, the morning fine, the glass-door stood
ajar, through it played a fresh breeze, and plants, growing at the
lintel, waved, bent, looked in, seeming to whisper tidings.</p>
<p id="id03286">M. Emanuel was not always quite punctual; we
scarcely wondered at his being a little late, but we wondered when
the door at last opened and, instead of him with his swiftness and
his fire, there came quietly upon us the cautious Madame Beck.</p>
<p id="id03287">She approached M. Paul's desk; she stood before it;
she drew round her the light shawl covering her shoulders;
beginning to speak in low, yet firm tones, and with a fixed gaze,
she said, "This morning there will be no lesson of literature."</p>
<p id="id03288">The second paragraph of her address followed, after
about two minutes' pause.</p>
<p id="id03289">"It is probable the lessons will be suspended for a
week. I shall require at least that space of time to find an
efficient substitute for M. Emanuel. Meanwhile, it shall be our
study to fill the blanks usefully.</p>
<p id="id03290">"Your Professor, ladies," she went on, "intends, if
possible, duly to take leave of you. At the present moment he has
not leisure for that ceremony. He is preparing for a long voyage. A
very sudden and urgent summons of duty calls him to a great
distance. He has decided to leave Europe for an indefinite time.
Perhaps he may tell you more himself. Ladies, instead of the usual
lesson with M. Emanuel, you will, this morning, read English with
Mademoiselle Lucy."</p>
<p id="id03291">She bent her head courteously, drew closer the
folds of her shawl, and passed from the classe.</p>
<p id="id03292">A great silence fell: then a murmur went round the
room: I believe some pupils wept.</p>
<p id="id03293">Some time elapsed. The noise, the whispering, the
occasional sobbing increased. I became conscious of a relaxation of
discipline, a sort of growing disorder, as if my girls felt that
vigilance was withdrawn, and that surveillance had virtually left
the classe. Habit and the sense of duty enabled me to rally
quickly, to rise in my usual way, to speak in my usual tone, to
enjoin, and finally to establish quiet. I made the English reading
long and close. I kept them at it the whole morning. I remember
feeling a sentiment of impatience towards the pupils who sobbed.
Indeed, their emotion was not of much value: it was only an
hysteric agitation. I told them so unsparingly. I half ridiculed
them. I was severe. The truth was, I could not do with their tears,
or that gasping sound; I could not bear it. A rather weak-minded,
low-spirited pupil kept it up when the others had done; relentless
necessity obliged and assisted me so to accost her, that she dared
not carry on the demonstration, that she was forced to conquer the
convulsion.</p>
<p id="id03294">That girl would have had a right to hate me, except
that, when school was over and her companions departing, I ordered
her to stay, and when they were gone, I did what I had never done
to one among them before&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;pressed her to my heart
and kissed her cheek. But, this impulse yielded to, I speedily put
her out of the classe, for, upon that poignant strain, she wept
more bitterly than ever.</p>
<p id="id03295">I filled with occupation every minute of that day,
and should have liked to sit up all night if I might have kept a
candle burning; the night, however, proved a bad time, and left bad
effects, preparing me ill for the next day's ordeal of insufferable
gossip. Of course this news fell under general discussion. Some
little reserve had accompanied the first surprise: that soon wore
off; every mouth opened; every tongue wagged; teachers, pupils, the
very servants, mouthed the name of "Emanuel." He, whose connection
with the school was contemporary with its commencement, thus
suddenly to withdraw! All felt it strange.</p>
<p id="id03296">They talked so much, so long, so often, that, out
of the very multitude of their words and rumours, grew at last some
intelligence. About the third day I heard it said that he was to
sail in a week; then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that he was bound for the
West Indies. I looked at Madame Beck's face, and into her eyes, for
disproof or confirmation of this report; I perused her all over for
information, but no part of her disclosed more than what was
unperturbed and commonplace.</p>
<p id="id03297">"This secession was an immense loss to her," she
alleged. "She did not know how she should fill up the vacancy. She
was so used to her kinsman, he had become her right hand; what
should she do without him? She had opposed the step, but M. Paul
had convinced her it was his duty."</p>
<p id="id03298">She said all this in public, in classe, at the
dinner-table, speaking audibly to Z&Atilde;&copy;lie St.
Pierre.</p>
<p id="id03299">"Why was it his duty?" I could have asked her that.
I had impulses to take hold of her suddenly, as she calmly passed
me in classe, to stretch out my hand and grasp her fast, and say,
"Stop. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. <i>Why</i>
is it his duty to go into banishment?" But Madame always addressed
some other teacher, and never looked at me, never seemed conscious
I could have a care in the question.</p>
<p id="id03300">The week wore on. Nothing more was said about M.
Emanuel coming to bid us good-by; and none seemed anxious for his
coming; none questioned whether or not he would come; none betrayed
torment lest he should depart silent and unseen; incessantly did
they talk, and never, in all their talk, touched on this vital
point. As to Madame, she of course could see him, and say to him as
much as she pleased. What should <i>she</i> care whether or not he
appeared in the schoolroom?</p>
<p id="id03301">The week consumed. We were told that he was going
on such a day, that his destination was "Basseterre in Guadaloupe:"
the business which called him abroad related to a friend's
interests, not his own: I thought as much.</p>
<p id="id03302">"Basseterre in Guadaloupe." I had little sleep
about this time, but whenever I <i>did</i> slumber, it followed
infallibly that I was quickly roused with a start, while the words
"Basseterre," "Guadaloupe," seemed pronounced over my pillow, or
ran athwart the darkness round and before me, in zigzag characters
of red or violet light.</p>
<p id="id03303">For what I felt there was no help, and how could I
help feeling? M. Emanuel had been very kind to me of late days; he
had been growing hourly better and kinder. It was now a month since
we had settled the theological difference, and in all that time
there had been no quarrel. Nor had our peace been the cold daughter
of divorce; we had not lived aloof; he had come oftener, he had
talked with me more than before; he had spent hours with me, with
temper soothed, with eye content, with manner home-like and mild.
Kind subjects of conversation had grown between us; he had inquired
into my plans of life, and I had communicated them; the school
project pleased him; he made me repeat it more than once, though he
called it an Alnaschar dream. The jar was over; the mutual
understanding was settling and fixing; feelings of union and hope
made themselves profoundly felt in the heart; affection and deep
esteem and dawning trust had each fastened its bond.</p>
<p id="id03304">What quiet lessons I had about this time! No more
taunts on my "intellect," no more menaces of grating public shows!
How sweetly, for the jealous gibe, and the more jealous,
half-passionate eulogy, were substituted a mute, indulgent help, a
fond guidance, and a tender forbearance which forgave but never
praised. There were times when he would sit for many minutes and
not speak at all; and when dusk or duty brought separation, he
would leave with words like these, "Il est doux, le repos! Il est
pr&Atilde;&copy;cieux le calme bonheur!"</p>
<p id="id03305">One evening, not ten short days since, he joined me
whilst walking in my alley. He took my hand. I looked up in his
face. I thought he meant to arrest my attention.</p>
<p id="id03306">"Bonne petite amie!" said he, softly; "douce
consolatrice!" But through his touch, and with his words, a new
feeling and a strange thought found a course. Could it be that he
was becoming more than friend or brother? Did his look speak a
kindness beyond fraternity or amity?</p>
<p id="id03307">His eloquent look had more to say, his hand drew me
forward, his interpreting lips stirred. No. Not now. Here into the
twilight alley broke an interruption: it came dual and ominous: we
faced two bodeful forms&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a woman's and a
priest's&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Madame Beck and P&Atilde;&uml;re
Silas.</p>
<p id="id03308">The aspect of the latter I shall never forget. On
the first impulse it expressed a Jean-Jacques sensibility, stirred
by the signs of affection just surprised; then, immediately,
darkened over it the jaundice of ecclesiastical jealousy. He spoke
to <i>me</i> with unction. He looked on his pupil with sternness.
As to Madame Beck, she, of course, saw
nothing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing; though her kinsman retained in
her presence the hand of the heretic foreigner, not suffering
withdrawal, but clasping it close and fast.</p>
<p id="id03309">Following these incidents, that sudden announcement
of departure had struck me at first as incredible. Indeed, it was
only frequent repetition, and the credence of the hundred and fifty
minds round me, which forced on me its full acceptance. As to that
week of suspense, with its blank, yet burning days, which brought
from him no word of explanation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I remember, but
I cannot describe its passage.</p>
<p id="id03310">The last day broke. Now would he visit us. Now he
would come and speak his farewell, or he would vanish mute, and be
seen by us nevermore.</p>
<p id="id03311">This alternative seemed to be present in the mind
of not a living creature in that school. All rose at the usual
hour; all breakfasted as usual; all, without reference to, or
apparent thought of their late Professor, betook themselves with
wonted phlegm to their ordinary duties.</p>
<p id="id03312">So oblivious was the house, so tame, so trained its
proceedings, so inexpectant its aspect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I scarce
knew how to breathe in an atmosphere thus stagnant, thus
smothering. Would no one lend me a voice? Had no one a wish, no one
a word, no one a prayer to which I could
say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Amen?</p>
<p id="id03313">I had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest
trifle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a treat, a holiday, a lesson's remission;
they could not, they <i>would</i> not now band to besiege Madame
Beck, and insist on a last interview with a Master who had
certainly been loved, at least by some&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;loved as
<i>they</i> could love&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but, oh! what <i>is</i>
the love of the multitude?</p>
<p id="id03314">I knew where he lived: I knew where he was to be
heard of, or communicated with; the distance was scarce a
stone's-throw: had it been in the next
room&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;unsummoned, I could make no use of my
knowledge. To follow, to seek out, to remind, to
recall&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for these things I had no faculty.</p>
<p id="id03315">M. Emanuel might have passed within reach of my
arm: had he passed silent and unnoticing, silent and stirless
should I have suffered him to go by.</p>
<p id="id03316">Morning wasted. Afternoon came, and I thought all
was over. My heart trembled in its place. My blood was troubled in
its current. I was quite sick, and hardly knew how to keep at my
post&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or do my work. Yet the little world round
me plodded on indifferent; all seemed jocund, free of care, or
fear, or thought: the very pupils who, seven days since, had wept
hysterically at a startling piece of news, appeared quite to have
forgotten the news, its import, and their emotion.</p>
<p id="id03317">A little before five o'clock, the hour of
dismissal, Madame Beck sent for me to her chamber, to read over and
translate some English letter she had received, and to write for
her the answer. Before settling to this work, I observed that she
softly closed the two doors of her chamber; she even shut and
fastened the casement, though it was a hot day, and free
circulation of air was usually regarded by her as indispensable.
Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an almost fierce distrust,
suggested such question. Did she want to exclude sound? what
sound?</p>
<p id="id03318">I listened as I had never listened before; I
listened like the evening and winter-wolf, snuffing the snow,
scenting prey, and hearing far off the traveller's tramp. Yet I
could both listen and write. About the middle of the letter I
heard&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what checked my pen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
tread in the vestibule. No door-bell had rung;
Rosine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;acting doubtless by
orders&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had anticipated such
r&Atilde;&copy;veill&Atilde;&copy;e. Madame saw me halt. She
coughed, made a bustle, spoke louder. The tread had passed on to
the classes.</p>
<p id="id03319">"Proceed," said Madame; but my hand was fettered,
my ear enchained, my thoughts were carried off captive.</p>
<p id="id03320">The classes formed another building; the hall
parted them from the dwelling-house: despite distance and
partition, I heard the sudden stir of numbers, a whole division
rising at once.</p>
<p id="id03321">"They are putting away work," said Madame.</p>
<p id="id03322">It was indeed the hour to put away work, but why
that sudden hush&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that instant quell of the
tumult?</p>
<p id="id03323">"Wait, Madame&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I will see what it
is."</p>
<p id="id03324">And I put down my pen and left her. Left her? No:
she would not be left: powerless to detain me, she rose and
followed, close as my shadow. I turned on the last step of the
stair.</p>
<p id="id03325">"Are you coming, too?" I asked.</p>
<p id="id03326">"Yes," said she; meeting my glance with a peculiar
aspect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a look, clouded, yet resolute.</p>
<p id="id03327">We proceeded then, not together, but she walked in
my steps.</p>
<p id="id03328">He was come. Entering the first classe, I saw him.
There, once more appeared the form most familiar. I doubt not they
had tried to keep him away, but he was come.</p>
<p id="id03329">The girls stood in a semicircle; he was passing
round, giving his farewells, pressing each hand, touching with his
lips each cheek. This last ceremony, foreign custom permitted at
such a parting&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so solemn, to last so long.</p>
<p id="id03330">I felt it hard that Madame Beck should dog me thus;
following and watching me close; my neck and shoulder shrunk in
fever under her breath; I became terribly goaded.</p>
<p id="id03331">He was approaching; the semicircle was almost
travelled round; he came to the last pupil; he turned. But Madame
was before me; she had stepped out suddenly; she seemed to magnify
her proportions and amplify her drapery; she eclipsed me; I was
hid. She knew my weakness and deficiency; she could calculate the
degree of moral paralysis&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the total default of
self-assertion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with which, in a crisis, I could
be struck. She hastened to her kinsman, she broke upon him volubly,
she mastered his attention, she hurried him to the
door&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the glass-door opening on the garden. I
think he looked round; could I but have caught his eye, courage, I
think, would have rushed in to aid feeling, and there would have
been a charge, and, perhaps, a rescue; but already the room was all
confusion, the semicircle broken into groups, my figure was lost
among thirty more conspicuous. Madame had her will; yes, she got
him away, and he had not seen me; he thought me absent. Five
o'clock struck, the loud dismissal-bell rang, the school separated,
the room emptied.</p>
<p id="id03332">There seems, to my memory, an entire darkness and
distraction in some certain minutes I then passed
alone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a grief inexpressible over a loss
unendurable. <i>What</i> should I do; oh! <i>what</i> should I do;
when all my life's hope was thus torn by the roots out of my riven,
outraged heart?</p>
<p id="id03333">What I <i>should</i> have done, I know not, when a
little child&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the least child in the
school&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;broke with its simplicity and its
unconsciousness into the raging yet silent centre of that inward
conflict.</p>
<p id="id03334">"Mademoiselle," lisped the treble voice, "I am to
give you that. M. Paul said I was to seek you all over the house,
from the grenier to the cellar, and when I found you, to give you
that."</p>
<p id="id03335">And the child delivered a note; the little dove
dropped on my knee, its olive leaf plucked off. I found neither
address nor name, only these words:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03336">"It was not my intention to take leave of you when
I said good-by to the rest, but I hoped to see you in classe. I was
disappointed. The interview is deferred. Be ready for me. Ere I
sail, I must see you at leisure, and speak with you at length. Be
ready; my moments are numbered, and, just now, monopolized;
besides, I have a private business on hand which I will not share
with any, nor communicate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even to
you.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;PAUL."</p>
<p id="id03337">"Be ready?" Then it must be this evening: was he
not to go on the morrow? Yes; of that point I was certain. I had
seen the date of his vessel's departure advertised. Oh! <i>I</i>
would be ready, but could that longed-for meeting really be
achieved? the time was so short, the schemers seemed so watchful,
so active, so hostile; the way of access appeared strait as a
gully, deep as a chasm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Apollyon straddled across
it, breathing flames. Could my Greatheart overcome? Could my guide
reach me?</p>
<p id="id03338">Who might tell? Yet I began to take some courage,
some comfort; it seemed to me that I felt a pulse of his heart
beating yet true to the whole throb of mine.</p>
<p id="id03339">I waited my champion. Apollyon came trailing his
Hell behind him. I think if Eternity held torment, its form would
not be fiery rack, nor its nature despair. I think that on a
certain day amongst those days which never dawned, and will not
set, an angel entered Hades&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stood, shone,
smiled, delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a
doubtful hope of bliss to come, not now, but at a day and hour
unlooked for, revealed in his own glory and grandeur the height and
compass of his promise: spoke thus&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;then
towering, became a star, and vanished into his own Heaven. His
legacy was suspense&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a worse boon than
despair.</p>
<p id="id03340">All that evening I waited, trusting in the
dove-sent olive-leaf, yet in the midst of my trust, terribly
fearing. My fear pressed heavy. Cold and peculiar, I knew it for
the partner of a rarely-belied presentiment. The first hours seemed
long and slow; in spirit I clung to the flying skirts of the last.
They passed like drift cloud&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;like the wrack
scudding before a storm.</p>
<p id="id03341">They passed. All the long, hot summer day burned
away like a Yule-log; the crimson of its close perished; I was left
bent among the cool blue shades, over the pale and ashen gleams of
its night.</p>
<p id="id03342">Prayers were over; it was bed-time; my co-inmates
were all retired. I still remained in the gloomy first classe,
forgetting, or at least disregarding, rules I had never forgotten
or disregarded before.</p>
<p id="id03343">How long I paced that classe I cannot tell; I must
have been afoot many hours; mechanically had I moved aside benches
and desks, and had made for myself a path down its length. There I
walked, and there, when certain that the whole household were abed,
and quite out of hearing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there, I at last wept.
Reliant on Night, confiding in Solitude, I kept my tears sealed, my
sobs chained, no longer; they heaved my heart; they tore their way.
In this house, what grief could be sacred?</p>
<p id="id03344">Soon after eleven o'clock&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a very
late hour in the Rue Fossette&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the door unclosed,
quietly but not stealthily; a lamp's flame invaded the moonlight;
Madame Beck entered, with the same composed air, as if coming on an
ordinary occasion, at an ordinary season. Instead of at once
addressing me, she went to her desk, took her keys, and seemed to
seek something: she loitered over this feigned search long, too
long. She was calm, too calm; my mood scarce endured the pretence;
driven beyond common range, two hours since I had left behind me
wonted respects and fears. Led by a touch, and ruled by a word,
under usual circumstances, no yoke could now be
borne&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no curb obeyed.</p>
<p id="id03345">"It is more than time for retirement," said Madame;
"the rule of the house has already been transgressed too long."</p>
<p id="id03346">Madame met no answer: I did not check my walk; when
she came in my way,<br />
I put her out of it.<br /></p>
<p id="id03347">"Let me persuade you to calm, Meess; let me lead
you to your chamber," said she, trying to speak softly.</p>
<p id="id03348">"No!" I said; "neither you nor another shall
persuade or lead me."</p>
<p id="id03349">"Your bed shall be warmed. Goton is sitting up
still. She shall make you comfortable: she shall give you a
sedative."</p>
<p id="id03350">"Madame," I broke out, "you are a sensualist. Under
all your serenity, your peace, and your decorum, you are an
undenied sensualist. Make your own bed warm and soft; take
sedatives and meats, and drinks spiced and sweet, as much as you
will. If you have any sorrow or
disappointment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and, perhaps, you
have&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nay, I <i>know</i> you
have&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;seek your own palliatives, in your own
chosen resources. Leave me, however. <i>Leave me</i>, I say!"</p>
<p id="id03351">"I must send another to watch you, Meess: I must
send Goton."</p>
<p id="id03352">"I forbid it. Let me alone. Keep your hand off me,
and my life, and my troubles. Oh, Madame! in <i>your</i> hand there
is both chill and poison. You envenom and you paralyze."</p>
<p id="id03353">"What have I done, Meess? You must not marry Paul.
He cannot marry."</p>
<p id="id03354">"Dog in the manger!" I said: for I knew she
secretly wanted him, and had always wanted him. She called him
"insupportable:" she railed at him for a "d&Atilde;&copy;vot:" she
did not love, but she wanted to marry, that she might bind him to
her interest. Deep into some of Madame's secrets I had
entered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I know not how: by an intuition or an
inspiration which came to me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I know not whence.
In the course of living with her too, I had slowly learned, that,
unless with an inferior, she must ever be a rival. She was
<i>my</i> rival, heart and soul, though secretly, under the
smoothest bearing, and utterly unknown to all save her and
myself.</p>
<p id="id03355">Two minutes I stood over Madame, feeling that the
whole woman was in my power, because in some moods, such as the
present&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in some stimulated states of perception,
like that of this instant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her habitual disguise,
her mask and her domino, were to me a mere network reticulated with
holes; and I saw underneath a being heartless, self-indulgent, and
ignoble. She quietly retreated from me: meek and self-possessed,
though very uneasy, she said, "If I would not be persuaded to take
rest, she must reluctantly leave me." Which she did incontinent,
perhaps even more glad to get away, than I was to see her
vanish.</p>
<p id="id03356">This was the sole flash-eliciting, truth-extorting,
rencontre which ever occurred between me and Madame Beck: this
short night-scene was never repeated. It did not one whit change
her manner to me. I do not know that she revenged it. I do not know
that she hated me the worse for my fell candour. I think she
bucklered herself with the secret philosophy of her strong mind,
and resolved to forget what it irked her to remember. I know that
to the end of our mutual lives there occurred no repetition of, no
allusion to, that fiery passage.</p>
<p id="id03357">That night passed: all
nights&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even the starless night before
dissolution&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;must wear away. About six o'clock,
the hour which called up the household, I went out to the court,
and washed my face in its cold, fresh well-water. Entering by the
carr&Atilde;&copy;, a piece of mirror-glass, set in an oaken
cabinet, repeated my image. It said I was changed: my cheeks and
lips were sodden white, my eyes were glassy, and my eyelids swollen
and purple.</p>
<p id="id03358">On rejoining my companions, I knew they all looked
at me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my heart seemed discovered to them: I
believed myself self-betrayed. Hideously certain did it seem that
the very youngest of the school must guess why and for whom I
despaired.</p>
<p id="id03359">"Isabelle," the child whom I had once nursed in
sickness, approached me. Would she, too, mock me!</p>
<p id="id03360">"Que vous &Atilde;&ordf;tes p&Atilde;&cent;le! Vous
&Atilde;&ordf;tes donc bien malade, Mademoiselle!" said she,
putting her finger in her mouth, and staring with a wistful
stupidity which at the moment seemed to me more beautiful than the
keenest intelligence.</p>
<p id="id03361">Isabelle did not long stand alone in the
recommendation of ignorance: before the day was over, I gathered
cause of gratitude towards the whole blind household. The multitude
have something else to do than to read hearts and interpret dark
sayings. Who wills, may keep his own counsel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;be
his own secret's sovereign. In the course of that day, proof met me
on proof, not only that the cause of my present sorrow was
unguessed, but that my whole inner life for the last six months,
was still mine only. It was not known&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it had not
been noted&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that I held in peculiar value one
life among all lives. Gossip had passed me by; curiosity had looked
me over; both subtle influences, hovering always round, had never
become centred upon me. A given organization may live in a full
fever-hospital, and escape typhus. M. Emanuel had come and gone: I
had been taught and sought; in season and out of season he had
called me, and I had obeyed him: "M. Paul wants Miss
Lucy"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Miss Lucy is with M.
Paul"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such had been the perpetual bulletin; and
nobody commented, far less condemned. Nobody hinted, nobody jested.
Madame Beck read the riddle: none else resolved it. What I now
suffered was called illness&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a headache: I
accepted the baptism.</p>
<p id="id03362">But what bodily illness was ever like this pain?
This certainty that he was gone without a
farewell&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this cruel conviction that fate and
pursuing furies&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a woman's envy and a priest's
bigotry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;would suffer me to see him no more? What
wonder that the second evening found me like the
first&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;untamed, tortured, again pacing a solitary
room in an unalterable passion of silent desolation?</p>
<p id="id03363">Madame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that
night&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she did not come near me: she sent Ginevra
Fanshawe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a more efficient agent for the purpose
she could not have employed. Ginevra's first
words&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Is your headache very bad to-night?" (for
Ginevra, like the rest, thought I had a
headache&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an intolerable headache which made me
frightfully white in the face, and insanely restless in the
foot)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;her first words, I say, inspired the
impulse to flee anywhere, so that it were only out of reach. And
soon, what followed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;plaints about her own
headaches&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;completed the business.</p>
<p id="id03364">I went up-stairs. Presently I was in my
bed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my miserable bed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;haunted
with quick scorpions. I had not been laid down five minutes, when
another emissary arrived: Goton came, bringing me something to
drink. I was consumed with thirst&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I drank
eagerly; the beverage was sweet, but I tasted a drug.</p>
<p id="id03365">"Madame says it will make you sleep, chou-chou,"
said Goton, as she received back the emptied cup.</p>
<p id="id03366">Ah! the sedative had been administered. In fact,
they had given me a strong opiate. I was to be held quiet for one
night.</p>
<p id="id03367">The household came to bed, the night-light was lit,
the dormitory hushed. Sleep soon reigned: over those pillows, sleep
won an easy supremacy: contented sovereign over heads and hearts
which did not ache&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he passed by the unquiet.</p>
<p id="id03368">The drug wrought. I know not whether Madame had
overcharged or under-charged the dose; its result was not that she
intended. Instead of stupor, came excitement. I became alive to new
thought&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to reverie peculiar in colouring. A
gathering call ran among the faculties, their bugles sang, their
trumpets rang an untimely summons. Imagination was roused from her
rest, and she came forth impetuous and venturous. With scorn she
looked on Matter, her mate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Rise!" she said.
"Sluggard! this night I will have <i>my</i> will; nor shalt thou
prevail."</p>
<p id="id03369">"Look forth and view the night!" was her cry; and
when I lifted the heavy blind from the casement close at
hand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with her own royal gesture, she showed me a
moon supreme, in an element deep and splendid.</p>
<p id="id03370">To my gasping senses she made the glimmering gloom,
the narrow limits, the oppressive heat of the dormitory,
intolerable. She lured me to leave this den and follow her forth
into dew, coolness, and glory.</p>
<p id="id03371">She brought upon me a strange vision of Villette at
midnight. Especially she showed the park, the summer-park, with its
long alleys all silent, lone and safe; among these lay a huge stone
basin&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that basin I knew, and beside which I had
often stood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;deep-set in the tree-shadows,
brimming with cool water, clear, with a green, leafy, rushy bed.
What of all this? The park-gates were shut up, locked, sentinelled:
the place could not be entered.</p>
<p id="id03372">Could it not? A point worth considering; and while
revolving it, I mechanically dressed. Utterly incapable of sleeping
or lying still&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;excited from head to
foot&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what could I do better than dress?</p>
<p id="id03373">The gates were locked, soldiers set before them:
was there, then, no admission to the park?</p>
<p id="id03374">The other day, in walking past, I had seen, without
then attending to the circumstance, a gap in the
paling&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one stake broken down: I now saw this gap
again in recollection&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;saw it very
plainly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the narrow, irregular aperture visible
between the stems of the lindens, planted orderly as a colonnade. A
man could not have made his way through that aperture, nor could a
stout woman, perhaps not Madame Beck; but I thought I might: I
fancied I should like to try, and once within, at this hour the
whole park would be mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the moonlight, midnight
park!</p>
<p id="id03375">How soundly the dormitory slept! What deep
slumbers! What quiet breathing! How very still the whole large
house! What was the time? I felt restless to know. There stood a
clock in the classe below: what hindered me from venturing down to
consult it? By such a moon, its large white face and jet black
figures must be vividly distinct.</p>
<p id="id03376">As for hindrance to this step, there offered not so
much as a creaking hinge or a clicking latch. On these hot July
nights, close air could not be tolerated, and the chamber-door
stood wide open. Will the dormitory-planks sustain my tread
untraitorous? Yes. I know wherever a board is loose, and will avoid
it. The oak staircase creaks somewhat as I descend, but not
much:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am in the carr&Atilde;&copy;.</p>
<p id="id03377">The great classe-doors are close shut: they are
bolted. On the other hand, the entrance to the corridor stands
open. The classes seem to my thought, great dreary jails, buried
far back beyond thoroughfares, and for me, filled with spectral and
intolerable Memories, laid miserable amongst their straw and their
manacles. The corridor offers a cheerful vista, leading to the high
vestibule which opens direct upon the street.</p>
<p id="id03378">Hush!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the clock strikes. Ghostly
deep as is the stillness of this convent, it is only eleven. While
my ear follows to silence the hum of the last stroke, I catch
faintly from the built-out capital, a sound like bells or like a
band&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sound where sweetness, where victory,
where mourning blend. Oh, to approach this music nearer, to listen
to it alone by the rushy basin! Let me go&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oh,
let me go! What hinders, what does not aid freedom?</p>
<p id="id03379">There, in the corridor, hangs my garden-costume, my
large hat, my shawl. There is no lock on the huge, heavy,
porte-coch&Atilde;&uml;re; there is no key to seek: it fastens with
a sort of spring-bolt, not to be opened from the outside, but
which, from within, may be noiselessly withdrawn. Can I manage it?
It yields to my hand, yields with propitious facility. I wonder as
that portal seems almost spontaneously to
unclose&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I wonder as I cross the threshold and
step on the paved street, wonder at the strange ease with which
this prison has been forced. It seems as if I had been pioneered
invisibly, as if some dissolving force had gone before me: for
myself, I have scarce made an effort.</p>
<p id="id03380">Quiet Rue Fossette! I find on this pavement that
wanderer-wooing summer night of which I mused; I see its moon over
me; I feel its dew in the air. But here I cannot stay; I am still
too near old haunts: so close under the dungeon, I can hear the
prisoners moan. This solemn peace is not what I seek, it is not
what I can bear: to me the face of that sky bears the aspect of a
world's death. The park also will be calm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I
know, a mortal serenity prevails everywhere&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;yet
let me seek the park.</p>
<p id="id03381">I took a route well known, and went up towards the
palatial and royal Haute-Ville; thence the music I had heard
certainly floated; it was hushed now, but it might re-waken. I went
on: neither band nor bell music came to meet me; another sound
replaced it, a sound like a strong tide, a great flow, deepening as
I proceeded. Light broke, movement gathered, chimes
pealed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to what was I coming? Entering on the
level of a Grande Place, I found myself, with the suddenness of
magic, plunged amidst a gay, living, joyous crowd.</p>
<p id="id03382">Villette is one blaze, one broad illumination; the
whole world seems abroad; moonlight and heaven are banished: the
town, by her own flambeaux, beholds her own
splendour&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gay dresses, grand equipages, fine
horses and gallant riders throng the bright streets. I see even
scores of masks. It is a strange scene, stranger than dreams. But
where is the park?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I ought to be near it. In the
midst of this glare the park must be shadowy and
calm&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>there</i>, at least, are neither
torches, lamps, nor crowd?</p>
<p id="id03383">I was asking this question when an open carriage
passed me filled with known faces. Through the deep throng it could
pass but slowly; the spirited horses fretted in their curbed
ardour. I saw the occupants of that carriage well: me they could
not see, or, at least, not know, folded close in my large shawl,
screened with my straw hat (in that motley crowd no dress was
noticeably strange). I saw the Count de Bassompierre; I saw my
godmother, handsomely apparelled, comely and cheerful; I saw, too,
Paulina Mary, compassed with the triple halo of her beauty, her
youth, and her happiness. In looking on her countenance of joy, and
eyes of festal light, one scarce remembered to note the gala
elegance of what she wore; I know only that the drapery floating
about her was all white and light and bridal; seated opposite to
her I saw Graham Bretton; it was in looking up at him her aspect
had caught its lustre&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the light repeated in
<i>her</i> eyes beamed first out of his.</p>
<p id="id03384">It gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends
viewlessly, and I <i>did</i> follow them, as I thought, to the
park. I watched them alight (carriages were inadmissible) amidst
new and unanticipated splendours. Lo! the iron gateway, between the
stone columns, was spanned by a flaming arch built of massed stars;
and, following them cautiously beneath that arch, where were they,
and where was I?</p>
<p id="id03385">In a land of enchantment, a garden most gorgeous, a
plain sprinkled with coloured meteors, a forest with sparks of
purple and ruby and golden fire gemming the foliage; a region, not
of trees and shadow, but of strangest architectural
wealth&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;of altar and of temple, of pyramid,
obelisk, and sphinx: incredible to say, the wonders and the symbols
of Egypt teemed throughout the park of Villette.</p>
<p id="id03386">No matter that in five minutes the secret was
mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the key of the mystery picked up, and its
illusion unveiled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no matter that I quickly
recognised the material of these solemn
fragments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the timber, the paint, and the
pasteboard&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;these inevitable discoveries failed
to quite destroy the charm, or undermine the marvel of that night.
No matter that I now seized the explanation of the whole great
f&Atilde;&ordf;te&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a f&Atilde;&ordf;te of which
the conventual Rue Fossette had not tasted, though it had opened at
dawn that morning, and was still in full vigour near midnight.</p>
<p id="id03387">In past days there had been, said history, an awful
crisis in the fate of Labassecour, involving I know not what peril
to the rights and liberties of her gallant citizens. Rumours of
wars there had been, if not wars themselves; a kind of struggling
in the streets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a bustle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
running to and fro, some rearing of barricades, some
burgher-rioting, some calling out of troops, much interchange of
brickbats, and even a little of shot. Tradition held that patriots
had fallen: in the old Basse-Ville was shown an enclosure, solemnly
built in and set apart, holding, it was said, the sacred bones of
martyrs. Be this as it may, a certain day in the year was still
kept as a festival in honour of the said patriots and martyrs of
somewhat apocryphal memory&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the morning being
given to a solemn Te Deum in St. Jean Baptiste, the evening devoted
to spectacles, decorations, and illuminations, such as these I now
saw.</p>
<p id="id03388">While looking up at the image of a white ibis,
fixed on a column&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;while fathoming the deep,
torch-lit perspective of an avenue, at the close of which was
couched a sphinx&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I lost sight of the party
which, from the middle of the great square, I had
followed&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or, rather, they vanished like a group
of apparitions. On this whole scene was impressed a dream-like
character: every shape was wavering, every movement floating, every
voice echo-like&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;half-mocking, half-uncertain.
Paulina and her friends being gone, I scarce could avouch that I
had really seen them; nor did I miss them as guides through the
chaos, far less regret them as protectors amidst the night.</p>
<p id="id03389">That festal night would have been safe for a very
child. Half the peasantry had come in from the outlying environs of
Villette, and the decent burghers were all abroad and around,
dressed in their best. My straw-hat passed amidst cap and jacket,
short petticoat, and long calico mantle, without, perhaps,
attracting a glance; I only took the precaution to bind down the
broad leaf gipsy-wise, with a supplementary
ribbon&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and then I felt safe as if masked.</p>
<p id="id03390">Safe I passed down the
avenues&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;safe I mixed with the crowd where it was
deepest. To be still was not in my power, nor quietly to observe. I
took a revel of the scene; I drank the elastic
night-air&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the swell of sound, the dubious light,
now flashing, now fading. As to Happiness or Hope, they and I had
shaken hands, but just now&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I scorned
Despair.</p>
<p id="id03391">My vague aim, as I went, was to find the
stone-basin, with its clear depth and green lining: of that
coolness and verdure I thought, with the passionate thirst of
unconscious fever. Amidst the glare, and hurry, and throng, and
noise, I still secretly and chiefly longed to come on that circular
mirror of crystal, and surprise the moon glassing therein her
pearly front.</p>
<p id="id03392">I knew my route, yet it seemed as if I was hindered
from pursuing it direct: now a sight, and now a sound, called me
aside, luring me down this alley and down that. Already I saw the
thick-planted trees which framed this tremulous and rippled glass,
when, choiring out of a glade to the right, broke such a sound as I
thought might be heard if Heaven were to
open&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such a sound, perhaps, as <i>was</i> heard
above the plain of Bethlehem, on the night of glad tidings.</p>
<p id="id03393">The song, the sweet music, rose afar, but rushing
swiftly on fast-strengthening pinions&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there
swept through these shades so full a storm of harmonies that, had
no tree been near against which to lean, I think I must have
dropped. Voices were there, it seemed to me, unnumbered;
instruments varied and countless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bugle, horn,
and trumpet I knew. The effect was as a sea breaking into song with
all its waves.</p>
<p id="id03394">The swaying tide swept this way, and then it fell
back, and I followed its retreat. It led me towards a Byzantine
building&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a sort of kiosk near the park's centre.
Round about stood crowded thousands, gathered to a grand concert in
the open air. What I had heard was, I think, a wild
J&Atilde;&curren;ger chorus; the night, the space, the scene, and
my own mood, had but enhanced the sounds and their impression.</p>
<p id="id03395">Here were assembled ladies, looking by this light
most beautiful: some of their dresses were gauzy, and some had the
sheen of satin, the flowers and the blond trembled, and the veils
waved about their decorated bonnets, as that host-like chorus, with
its greatly-gathering sound, sundered the air above them. Most of
these ladies occupied the little light park-chairs, and behind and
beside them stood guardian gentlemen. The outer ranks of the crowd
were made up of citizens, plebeians and police.</p>
<p id="id03396">In this outer rank I took my place. I rather liked
to find myself the silent, unknown, consequently unaccosted
neighbour of the short petticoat and the sabot; and only the
distant gazer at the silk robe, the velvet mantle, and the plumed
chapeau. Amidst so much life and joy, too, it suited me to be
alone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quite alone. Having neither wish nor power
to force my way through a mass so close-packed, my station was on
the farthest confines, where, indeed, I might hear, but could see
little.</p>
<p id="id03397">"Mademoiselle is not well placed," said a voice at
my elbow. Who dared accost <i>me</i>, a being in a mood so little
social? I turned, rather to repel than to reply. I saw a
man&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a burgher&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an entire
stranger, as I deemed him for one moment, but the next, recognised
in him a certain tradesman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a bookseller, whose
shop furnished the Rue Fossette with its books and stationery; a
man notorious in our pensionnat for the excessive brittleness of
his temper, and frequent snappishness of his manner, even to us,
his principal customers: but whom, for my solitary self, I had ever
been disposed to like, and had always found civil, sometimes kind;
once, in aiding me about some troublesome little exchange of
foreign money, he had done me a service. He was an intelligent man;
under his asperity, he was a good-hearted man; the thought had
sometimes crossed me, that a part of his nature bore affinity to a
part of M. Emanuel's (whom he knew well, and whom I had often seen
sitting on Miret's counter, turning over the current month's
publications); and it was in this affinity I read the explanation
of that conciliatory feeling with which I instinctively regarded
him.</p>
<p id="id03398">Strange to say, this man knew me under my straw-hat
and closely-folded shawl; and, though I deprecated the effort, he
insisted on making a way for me through the crowd, and finding me a
better situation. He carried his disinterested civility further;
and, from some quarter, procured me a chair. Once and again, I have
found that the most cross-grained are by no means the worst of
mankind; nor the humblest in station, the least polished in
feeling. This man, in his courtesy, seemed to find nothing strange
in my being here alone; only a reason for extending to me, as far
as he could, a retiring, yet efficient attention. Having secured me
a place and a seat, he withdrew without asking a question, without
obtruding a remark, without adding a superfluous word. No wonder
that Professor Emanuel liked to take his cigar and his lounge, and
to read his feuilleton in M. Miret's shop&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
two must have suited.</p>
<p id="id03399">I had not been seated five minutes, ere I became
aware that chance and my worthy burgher friend had brought me once
more within view of a familiar and domestic group. Right before me
sat the Brettons and de Bassompierres. Within reach of my
hand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;had I chosen to extend
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;sat a figure like a fairy-queen, whose array,
lilies and their leaves seemed to have suggested; whatever was not
spotless white, being forest-green. My godmother, too, sat so near,
that, had I leaned forward, my breath might have stirred the ribbon
of her bonnet. They were too near; having been just recognised by a
comparative stranger, I felt uneasy at this close vicinage of
intimate acquaintance.</p>
<p id="id03400">It made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton, turning
to Mr. Home, and speaking out of a kind impulse of memory,
said,&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"I wonder what my steady little Lucy would
say to all this if she were here? I wish we had brought her, she
would have enjoyed it much."</p>
<p id="id03401">"So she would, so she would, in her grave sensible
fashion; it is a pity but we had asked her," rejoined the kind
gentleman; and added, "I like to see her so quietly pleased; so
little moved, yet so content."</p>
<p id="id03402">Dear were they both to me, dear are they to this
day in their remembered benevolence. Little knew they the rack of
pain which had driven Lucy almost into fever, and brought her out,
guideless and reckless, urged and drugged to the brink of frenzy. I
had half a mind to bend over the elders' shoulders, and answer
their goodness with the thanks of my eyes. M. de Bassompierre did
not well know <i>me</i>, but I knew <i>him</i>, and honoured and
admired his nature, with all its plain sincerity, its warm
affection, and unconscious enthusiasm. Possibly I might have
spoken, but just then Graham turned; he turned with one of his
stately firm movements, so different from those, of a
sharp-tempered under-sized man: there was behind him a throng, a
hundred ranks deep; there were thousands to meet his eye and divide
its scrutiny&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;why then did he concentrate all on
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oppressing me with the whole force of that
full, blue, steadfast orb? Why, if he <i>would</i> look, did not
one glance satisfy him? why did he turn on his chair, rest his
elbow on its back, and study me leisurely? He could not see my
face, I held it down; surely, he <i>could</i> not recognise me: I
stooped, I turned, I <i>would</i> not be known. He rose, by some
means he contrived to approach, in two minutes he would have had my
secret: my identity would have been grasped between his, never
tyrannous, but always powerful hands. There was but one way to
evade or to check him. I implied, by a sort of supplicatory
gesture, that it was my prayer to be let alone; after that, had he
persisted, he would perhaps have seen the spectacle of Lucy
incensed: not all that was grand, or good, or kind in him (and Lucy
felt the full amount) should have kept her quite tame, or
absolutely inoffensive and shadowlike. He looked, but he desisted.
He shook his handsome head, but he was mute. He resumed his seat,
nor did he again turn or disturb me by a glance, except indeed for
one single instant, when a look, rather solicitous than curious,
stole my way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;speaking what somehow stilled my
heart like "the south-wind quieting the earth." Graham's thoughts
of me were not entirely those of a frozen indifference, after all.
I believe in that goodly mansion, his heart, he kept one little
place under the sky-lights where Lucy might have entertainment, if
she chose to call. It was not so handsome as the chambers where he
lodged his male friends; it was not like the hall where he
accommodated his philanthropy, or the library where he treasured
his science, still less did it resemble the pavilion where his
marriage feast was splendidly spread; yet, gradually, by long and
equal kindness, he proved to me that he kept one little closet,
over the door of which was written "Lucy's Room." I kept a place
for him, too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a place of which I never took the
measure, either by rule or compass: I think it was like the tent of
Peri-Banou. All my life long I carried it folded in the hollow of
my hand yet, released from that hold and constriction, I know not
but its innate capacity for expanse might have magnified it into a
tabernacle for a host.</p>
<p id="id03403">Forbearing as he was to-night, I could not stay in
this proximity; this dangerous place and seat must be given up: I
watched my opportunity, rose, and stole away. He might think, he
might even believe that Lucy was contained within that shawl, and
sheltered under that hat; he never could be certain, for he did not
see my face.</p>
<p id="id03404">Surely the spirit of restlessness was by this time
appeased? Had I not had enough of adventure? Did I not begin to
flag, quail, and wish for safety under a roof? Not so. I still
loathed my bed in the school dormitory more than words can express:
I clung to whatever could distract thought. Somehow I felt, too,
that the night's drama was but begun, that the prologue was scarce
spoken: throughout this woody and turfy theatre reigned a shadow of
mystery; actors and incidents unlooked-for, waited behind the
scenes: I thought so foreboding told me as much.</p>
<p id="id03405">Straying at random, obeying the push of every
chance elbow, I was brought to a quarter where trees planted in
clusters, or towering singly, broke up somewhat the dense packing
of the crowd, and gave it a more scattered character. These
confines were far from the music, and somewhat aloof even from the
lamps, but there was sound enough to soothe, and with that full,
high moon, lamps were scarce needed. Here had chiefly settled
family-groups, burgher-parents; some of them, late as was the hour,
actually surrounded by their children, with whom it had not been
thought advisable to venture into the closer throng.</p>
<p id="id03406">Three fine tall trees growing close, almost twined
stem within stem, lifted a thick canopy of shade above a green
knoll, crowned with a seat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a seat which might
have held several, yet it seemed abandoned to one, the remaining
members of the fortunate party in possession of this site standing
dutifully round; yet, amongst this reverend circle was a lady,
holding by the hand a little girl.</p>
<p id="id03407">When I caught sight of this little girl, she was
twisting herself round on her heel, swinging from her conductress's
hand, flinging herself from side to side with wanton and fantastic
gyrations. These perverse movements arrested my attention, they
struck me as of a character fearfully familiar. On close
inspection, no less so appeared the child's equipment; the lilac
silk pelisse, the small swansdown boa, the white
bonnet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the whole holiday toilette, in short, was
the gala garb of a cherub but too well known, of that tadpole,
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e Beck&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e Beck it
was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she, or an imp in her likeness.</p>
<p id="id03408">I might have taken this discovery as a
thunder-clap, but such hyperbole would have been premature;
discovery was destined to rise more than one degree, ere it reached
its climax.</p>
<p id="id03409">On whose hand could the amiable
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e swing thus selfishly, whose glove
could she tear thus recklessly, whose arm thus strain with
impunity, or on the borders of whose dress thus turn and trample
insolently, if not the hand, glove, arm, and robe of her
lady-mother? And there, in an Indian shawl and a pale-green crape
bonnet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there, fresh, portly, blithe, and
pleasant&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there stood Madame Beck.</p>
<p id="id03410">Curious! I had certainly deemed Madame in her bed,
and D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e in her crib, at this blessed
minute, sleeping, both of them, the sleep of the just, within the
sacred walls, amidst the profound seclusion of the Rue Fossette.
Most certainly also they did not picture "Meess Lucie" otherwise
engaged; and here we all three were taking our "&Atilde;&copy;bats"
in the f&Atilde;&ordf;te-blazing park at midnight!</p>
<p id="id03411">The fact was, Madame was only acting according to
her quite justifiable wont. I remembered now I had heard it said
among the teachers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though without at the time
particularly noticing the gossip&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that often,
when we thought Madame in her chamber, sleeping, she was gone,
full-dressed, to take her pleasure at operas, or plays, or balls.
Madame had no sort of taste for a monastic life, and took
care&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;largely, though
discreetly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to season her existence with a relish
of the world.</p>
<p id="id03412">Half a dozen gentlemen of her friends stood about
her. Amongst these, I was not slow to recognise two or three. There
was her brother, M. Victor Kint; there was another person,
moustached and with long hair&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a calm, taciturn
man, but whose traits bore a stamp and a semblance I could not mark
unmoved. Amidst reserve and phlegm, amidst contrasts of character
and of countenance, something there still was which recalled a
face&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;mobile, fervent,
feeling&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a face changeable, now clouded, and now
alight&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a face from my world taken away, for my
eyes lost, but where my best spring-hours of life had alternated in
shadow and in glow; that face, where I had often seen movements so
near the signs of genius&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that why there did not
shine fully out the undoubted fire, the thing, the spirit, and the
secret itself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I could never tell.
Yes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this Josef Emanuel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this
man of peace&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;reminded me of his ardent
brother.</p>
<p id="id03413">Besides Messieurs Victor and Josef, I knew another
of this party. This third person stood behind and in the shade, his
attitude too was stooping, yet his dress and bald white head made
him the most conspicuous figure of the group. He was an
ecclesiastic: he was P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas. Do not fancy, reader,
that there was any inconsistency in the priest's presence at this
f&Atilde;&ordf;te. This was not considered a show of Vanity Fair,
but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice. The Church patronised
it, even with ostentation. There were troops of priests in the park
that night.</p>
<p id="id03414">P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas stooped over the seat with
its single occupant, the rustic bench and that which sat upon it: a
strange mass it was&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bearing no shape, yet
magnificent. You saw, indeed, the outline of a face, and features,
but these were so cadaverous and so strangely placed, you could
almost have fancied a head severed from its trunk, and flung at
random on a pile of rich merchandise. The distant lamp-rays glanced
on clear pendants, on broad rings; neither the chasteness of
moonlight, nor the distance of the torches, could quite subdue the
gorgeous dyes of the drapery. Hail, Madame Walravens! I think you
looked more witch-like than ever. And presently the good lady
proved that she was indeed no corpse or ghost, but a harsh and
hardy old woman; for, upon some aggravation in the clamorous
petition of D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e Beck to her mother,
to go to the kiosk and take sweetmeats, the hunchback suddenly
fetched her a resounding rap with her gold-knobbed cane.</p>
<p id="id03415">There, then, were Madame Walravens, Madame Beck,
P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the whole conjuration,
the secret junta. The sight of them thus assembled did me good. I
cannot say that I felt weak before them, or abashed, or dismayed.
They outnumbered me, and I was worsted and under their feet; but,
as yet, I was not dead.</p>
<h2 id="id03416" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h5 id="id03417">OLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</h5>
<p id="id03418" style="margin-top: 2em">Fascinated as by a basilisk
with three heads, I could not leave this clique; the ground near
them seemed to hold my feet. The canopy of entwined trees held out
shadow, the night whispered a pledge of protection, and an
officious lamp flashed just one beam to show me an obscure, safe
seat, and then vanished. Let me now briefly tell the reader all
that, during the past dark fortnight, I have been silently
gathering from Rumour, respecting the origin and the object of M.
Emanuel's departure. The tale is short, and not new: its alpha is
Mammon, and its omega Interest.</p>
<p id="id03419">If Madame Walravens was hideous as a Hindoo idol,
she seemed also to possess, in the estimation of these her
votaries, an idol's consequence. The fact was, she had been
rich&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;very rich; and though, for the present,
without the command of money, she was likely one day to be rich
again. At Basseterre, in Guadaloupe, she possessed a large estate,
received in dowry on her marriage sixty years ago, sequestered
since her husband's failure; but now, it was supposed, cleared of
claim, and, if duly looked after by a competent agent of integrity,
considered capable of being made, in a few years, largely
productive.</p>
<p id="id03420">P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas took an interest in this
prospective improvement for the sake of religion and the church,
whereof Magliore Walravens was a devout daughter. Madame Beck,
distantly related to the hunchback and knowing her to be without
family of her own, had long brooded over contingencies with a
mother's calculating forethought, and, harshly treated as she was
by Madame Walravens, never ceased to court her for interest's sake.
Madame Beck and the priest were thus, for money reasons, equally
and sincerely interested in the nursing of the West Indian
estate.</p>
<p id="id03421">But the distance was great, and the climate
hazardous. The competent and upright agent wanted, must be a
devoted man. Just such a man had Madame Walravens retained for
twenty years in her service, blighting his life, and then living on
him, like an old fungus; such a man had P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas
trained, taught, and bound to him by the ties of gratitude, habit,
and belief. Such a man Madame Beck knew, and could in some measure
influence. "My pupil," said P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas, "if he remains
in Europe, runs risk of apostacy, for he has become entangled with
a heretic." Madame Beck made also her private comment, and
preferred in her own breast her secret reason for desiring
expatriation. The thing she could not obtain, she desired not
another to win: rather would she destroy it. As to Madame
Walravens, she wanted her money and her land, and knew Paul, if he
liked, could make the best and faithfullest steward: so the three
self-seekers banded and beset the one unselfish. They reasoned,
they appealed, they implored; on his mercy they cast themselves,
into his hands they confidingly thrust their interests. They asked
but two or three years of devotion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;after that,
he should live for himself: one of the number, perhaps, wished that
in the meantime he might die.</p>
<p id="id03422">No living being ever humbly laid his advantage at
M. Emanuel's feet, or confidingly put it into his hands, that he
spurned the trust or repulsed the repository. What might be his
private pain or inward reluctance to leave
Europe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what his calculations for his own
future&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;none asked, or knew, or reported. All
this was a blank to me. His conferences with his confessor I might
guess; the part duty and religion were made to play in the
persuasions used, I might conjecture. He was gone, and had made no
sign. There my knowledge closed.</p>
<p id="id03423">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03424">With my head bent, and my forehead resting on my
hands, I sat amidst grouped tree-stems and branching brushwood.
Whatever talk passed amongst my neighbours, I might hear, if I
would; I was near enough; but for some time, there was scarce
motive to attend. They gossiped about the dresses, the music, the
illuminations, the fine night. I listened to hear them say, "It is
calm weather for <i>his</i> voyage; the <i>Antigua</i>" (his ship)
"will sail prosperously." No such remark fell; neither the
<i>Antigua</i>, nor her course, nor her passenger were named.</p>
<p id="id03425">Perhaps the light chat scarcely interested old
Madame Walravens more than it did me; she appeared restless,
turning her head now to this side, now that, looking through the
trees, and among the crowd, as if expectant of an arrival and
impatient of delay. "O&Atilde;&sup1; sont-ils? Pourquoi ne
viennent-ils?" I heard her mutter more than once; and at last, as
if determined to have an answer to her
question&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which hitherto none seemed to mind, she
spoke aloud this phrase&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a phrase brief enough,
simple enough, but it sent a shock through
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Messieurs et mesdames," said she,
"o&Atilde;&sup1; donc est Justine Marie?"</p>
<p id="id03426">"Justine Marie!" What was this? Justine
Marie&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the dead nun&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where was
she? Why, in her grave, Madame Walravens&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what
can you want with her? You shall go to her, but she shall not come
to you.</p>
<p id="id03427">Thus <i>I</i> should have answered, had the
response lain with me, but nobody seemed to be of my mind; nobody
seemed surprised, startled, or at a loss. The quietest commonplace
answer met the strange, the dead-disturbing, the Witch-of-Endor
query of the hunchback.</p>
<p id="id03428">"Justine Marie," said one, "is coming; she is in
the kiosk; she will be here presently."</p>
<p id="id03429">Out of this question and reply sprang a change in
the chat&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;chat it still remained, easy,
desultory, familiar gossip. Hint, allusion, comment, went round the
circle, but all so broken, so dependent on references to persons
not named, or circumstances not defined, that listen as intently as
I would&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I <i>did</i> listen <i>now</i> with
a fated interest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I could make out no more than
that some scheme was on foot, in which this ghostly Justine
Marie&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;dead or alive&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;was
concerned. This family-junta seemed grasping at her somehow, for
some reason; there seemed question of a marriage, of a
fortune&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for whom I could not quite make
out-perhaps for Victor Kint, perhaps for Josef
Emanuel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;both were bachelors. Once I thought the
hints and jests rained upon a young fair-haired foreigner of the
party, whom they called Heinrich M&Atilde;&frac14;hler. Amidst all
the badinage, Madame Walravens still obtruded from time to time,
hoarse, cross-grained speeches; her impatience being diverted only
by an implacable surveillance of D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e,
who could not stir but the old woman menaced her with her
staff.</p>
<p id="id03430">"La voil&Atilde;&nbsp;!" suddenly cried one of the
gentlemen, "voil&Atilde;&nbsp; Justine Marie qui arrive!"</p>
<p id="id03431">This moment was for me peculiar. I called up to
memory the pictured nun on the panel; present to my mind was the
sad love-story; I saw in thought the vision of the garret, the
apparition of the alley, the strange birth of the berceau; I
underwent a presentiment of discovery, a strong conviction of
coming disclosure. Ah! when imagination once runs riot where do we
stop? What winter tree so bare and
branchless&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what way-side, hedge-munching animal
so humble, that Fancy, a passing cloud, and a struggling moonbeam,
will not clothe it in spirituality, and make of it a phantom?</p>
<p id="id03432">With solemn force pressed on my heart, the
expectation of mystery breaking up: hitherto I had seen this
spectre only through a glass darkly; now was I to behold it face to
face. I leaned forward; I looked.</p>
<p id="id03433">"She comes!" cried Josef Emanuel.</p>
<p id="id03434">The circle opened as if opening to admit a new and
welcome member. At this instant a torch chanced to be carried past;
its blaze aided the pale moon in doing justice to the crisis, in
lighting to perfection the d&Atilde;&copy;nouement pressing on.
Surely those near me must have felt some little of the anxiety I
felt, in degree so unmeted. Of that group the coolest must have
"held his breath for a time!" As for me, my life stood still.</p>
<p id="id03435">It is over. The moment and the nun are come. The
crisis and the revelation are passed by.</p>
<p id="id03436">The flambeau glares still within a yard, held up in
a park-keeper's<br />
hand; its long eager tongue of flame almost licks the figure of
the<br />
Expected&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;there&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where she
stands full in my sight. What is she like?<br />
What does she wear? How does she look? Who is she?<br /></p>
<p id="id03437">There are many masks in the park to-night, and as
the hour wears late, so strange a feeling of revelry and mystery
begins to spread abroad, that scarce would you discredit me,
reader, were I to say that she is like the nun of the attic, that
she wears black skirts and white head-clothes, that she looks the
resurrection of the flesh, and that she is a risen ghost.</p>
<p id="id03438">All falsities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all figments! We
will not deal in this gear. Let us be honest, and cut, as
heretofore, from the homely web of truth.</p>
<p id="id03439"><i>Homely</i>, though, is an ill-chosen word. What
I see is not precisely homely. A girl of Villette stands
there&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a girl fresh from her pensionnat. She is
very comely, with the beauty indigenous to this country. She looks
well-nourished, fair, and fat of flesh. Her cheeks are round, her
eyes good; her hair is abundant. She is handsomely dressed. She is
not alone; her escort consists of three
persons&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;two being elderly; these she addresses
as "Mon Oncle" and "Ma Tante." She laughs, she chats;
good-humoured, buxom, and blooming, she looks, at all points, the
bourgeoise belle.</p>
<p id="id03440">"So much for Justine Marie;" so much for ghosts and
mystery: not that this last was solved&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;this girl
certainly is not my nun: what I saw in the garret and garden must
have been taller by a span.</p>
<p id="id03441">We have looked at the city belle; we have cursorily
glanced at the respectable old uncle and aunt. Have we a stray
glance to give to the third member of this company? Can we spare
him a moment's notice? We ought to distinguish him so far, reader;
he has claims on us; we do not now meet him for the first time. I
clasped my hands very hard, and I drew my breath very deep: I held
in the cry, I devoured the ejaculation, I forbade the start, I
spoke and I stirred no more than a stone; but I knew what I looked
on; through the dimness left in my eyes by many nights' weeping, I
knew him. They said he was to sail by the <i>Antigua</i>. Madame
Beck said so. She lied, or she had uttered what was once truth, and
failed to contradict it when it became false. The <i>Antigua</i>
was gone, and there stood Paul Emanuel.</p>
<p id="id03442">Was I glad? A huge load left me. Was it a fact to
warrant joy? I know not. Ask first what were the circumstances
attendant on this respite? How far did this delay concern
<i>me?</i> Were there not those whom it might touch more
nearly?</p>
<p id="id03443">After all, who may this young girl, this Justine
Marie, be? Not a stranger, reader; she is known to me by sight; she
visits at the Rue Fossette: she is often of Madame Beck's Sunday
parties. She is a relation of both the Becks and Walravens; she
derives her baptismal name from the sainted nun who would have been
her aunt had she lived; her patronymic is Sauveur; she is an
heiress and an orphan, and M. Emanuel is her guardian; some say her
godfather.</p>
<p id="id03444">The family junta wish this heiress to be married to
one of their band&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which is it? Vital
question&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which is it?</p>
<p id="id03445">I felt very glad now, that the drug administered in
the sweet draught had filled me with a possession which made bed
and chamber intolerable. I always, through my whole life, liked to
penetrate to the real truth; I like seeking the goddess in her
temple, and handling the veil, and daring the dread glance. O
Titaness among deities! the covered outline of thine aspect sickens
often through its uncertainty, but define to us one trait, show us
one lineament, clear in awful sincerity; we may gasp in untold
terror, but with that gasp we drink in a breath of thy divinity;
our heart shakes, and its currents sway like rivers lifted by
earthquake, but we have swallowed strength. To see and know the
worst is to take from Fear her main advantage.</p>
<p id="id03446">The Walravens' party, augmented in numbers, now
became very gay. The gentlemen fetched refreshments from the kiosk,
all sat down on the turf under the trees; they drank healths and
sentiments; they laughed, they jested. M. Emanuel underwent some
raillery, half good-humoured, half, I thought, malicious,
especially on Madame Beck's part. I soon gathered that his voyage
had been temporarily deferred of his own will, without the
concurrence, even against the advice, of his friends; he had let
the <i>Antigua</i> go, and had taken his berth in the <i>Paul et
Virginie</i>, appointed to sail a fortnight later. It was his
reason for this resolve which they teased him to assign, and which
he would only vaguely indicate as "the settlement of a little piece
of business which he had set his heart upon." What <i>was</i> this
business? Nobody knew. Yes, there was one who seemed partly, at
least, in his confidence; a meaning look passed between him and
Justine Marie. "La petite va m'aider&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;n'est-ce
pas?" said he. The answer was prompt enough, God knows?</p>
<p id="id03447">"Mais oui, je vous aiderai de tout mon coeur. Vous
ferez de moi tout ce que vous voudrez, mon parrain."</p>
<p id="id03448">And this dear "parrain" took her hand and lifted it
to his grateful lips. Upon which demonstration, I saw the
light-complexioned young Teuton, Heinrich M&Atilde;&frac14;hler,
grow restless, as if he did not like it. He even grumbled a few
words, whereat M. Emanuel actually laughed in his face, and with
the ruthless triumph of the assured conqueror, he drew his ward
nearer to him.</p>
<p id="id03449">M. Emanuel was indeed very joyous that night. He
seemed not one whit subdued by the change of scene and action
impending. He was the true life of the party; a little despotic,
perhaps, determined to be chief in mirth, as well as in labour, yet
from moment to moment proving indisputably his right of leadership.
His was the wittiest word, the pleasantest anecdote, the frankest
laugh. Restlessly active, after his manner, he multiplied himself
to wait on all; but oh! I saw which was his favourite. I saw at
whose feet he lay on the turf, I saw whom he folded carefully from
the night air, whom he tended, watched, and cherished as the apple
of his eye.</p>
<p id="id03450">Still, hint and raillery flew thick, and still I
gathered that while M. Paul should be absent, working for others,
these others, not quite ungrateful, would guard for him the
treasure he left in Europe. Let him bring them an Indian fortune:
they would give him in return a young bride and a rich inheritance.
As for the saintly consecration, the vow of constancy, that was
forgotten: the blooming and charming Present prevailed over the
Past; and, at length, his nun was indeed buried.</p>
<p id="id03451">Thus it must be. The revelation was indeed come.
Presentiment had not been mistaken in her impulse: there is a kind
of presentiment which never <i>is</i> mistaken; it was I who had
for a moment miscalculated; not seeing the true bearing of the
oracle, I had thought she muttered of vision when, in truth, her
prediction touched reality.</p>
<p id="id03452">I might have paused longer upon what I saw; I might
have deliberated ere I drew inferences. Some, perhaps, would have
held the premises doubtful, the proofs insufficient; some slow
sceptics would have incredulously examined ere they conclusively
accepted the project of a marriage between a poor and unselfish man
of forty, and his wealthy ward of eighteen; but far from me such
shifts and palliatives, far from me such temporary evasion of the
actual, such coward fleeing from the dread, the swift-footed, the
all-overtaking Fact, such feeble suspense of submission to her the
sole sovereign, such paltering and faltering resistance to the
Power whose errand is to march conquering and to conquer, such
traitor defection from the TRUTH.</p>
<p id="id03453">No. I hastened to accept the whole plan. I extended
my grasp and took it all in. I gathered it to me with a sort of
rage of haste, and folded it round me, as the soldier struck on the
field folds his colours about his breast. I invoked Conviction to
nail upon me the certainty, abhorred while embraced, to fix it with
the strongest spikes her strongest strokes could drive; and when
the iron had entered well my soul, I stood up, as I thought,
renovated.</p>
<p id="id03454">In my infatuation, I said, "Truth, you are a good
mistress to your faithful servants! While a Lie pressed me, how I
suffered! Even when the Falsehood was still sweet, still flattering
to the fancy, and warm to the feelings, it wasted me with hourly
torment. The persuasion that affection was won could not be
divorced from the dread that, by another turn of the wheel, it
might be lost. Truth stripped away Falsehood, and Flattery, and
Expectancy, and here I stand&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;free!"</p>
<p id="id03455">Nothing remained now but to take my freedom to my
chamber, to carry it with me to my bed and see what I could make of
it. The play was not yet, indeed, quite played out. I might have
waited and watched longer that love-scene under the trees, that
sylvan courtship. Had there been nothing of love in the
demonstration, my Fancy in this hour was so generous, so creative,
she could have modelled for it the most salient lineaments, and
given it the deepest life and highest colour of passion. But I
<i>would</i> not look; I had fixed my resolve, but I would not
violate my nature. And then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;something tore me so
cruelly under my shawl, something so dug into my side, a vulture so
strong in beak and talon, I must be alone to grapple with it. I
think I never felt jealousy till now. This was not like enduring
the endearments of Dr. John and Paulina, against which while I
sealed my eyes and my ears, while I withdrew thence my thoughts, my
sense of harmony still acknowledged in it a charm. This was an
outrage. The love born of beauty was not mine; I had nothing in
common with it: I could not dare to meddle with it, but another
love, venturing diffidently into life after long acquaintance,
furnace-tried by pain, stamped by constancy, consolidated by
affection's pure and durable alloy, submitted by intellect to
intellect's own tests, and finally wrought up, by his own process,
to his own unflawed completeness, this Love that laughed at
Passion, his fast frenzies and his hot and hurried extinction, in
<i>this</i> Love I had a vested interest; and whatever tended
either to its culture or its destruction, I could not view
impassibly.</p>
<p id="id03456">I turned from the group of trees and the "merrie
companie" in its shade. Midnight was long past; the concert was
over, the crowds were thinning. I followed the ebb. Leaving the
radiant park and well-lit Haute-Ville (still well lit, this it
seems was to be a "nuit blanche" in Villette), I sought the dim
lower quarter.</p>
<p id="id03457">Dim I should not say, for the beauty of
moonlight&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;forgotten in the
park&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;here once more flowed in upon perception.
High she rode, and calm and stainlessly she shone. The music and
the mirth of the f&Atilde;&ordf;te, the fire and bright hues of
those lamps had out-done and out-shone her for an hour, but now,
again, her glory and her silence triumphed. The rival lamps were
dying: she held her course like a white fate. Drum, trumpet, bugle,
had uttered their clangour, and were forgotten; with pencil-ray she
wrote on heaven and on earth records for archives everlasting. She
and those stars seemed to me at once the types and witnesses of
truth all regnant. The night-sky lit her reign: like its
slow-wheeling progress, advanced her
victory&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that onward movement which has been, and
is, and will be from eternity to eternity.</p>
<p id="id03458">These oil-twinkling streets are very still: I like
them for their lowliness and peace. Homeward-bound burghers pass me
now and then, but these companies are pedestrians, make little
noise, and are soon gone. So well do I love Villette under her
present aspect, not willingly would I re-enter under a roof, but
that I am bent on pursuing my strange adventure to a successful
close, and quietly regaining my bed in the great dormitory, before
Madame Beck comes home.</p>
<p id="id03459">Only one street lies between me and the Rue
Fossette; as I enter it, for the first time, the sound of a
carriage tears up the deep peace of this quarter. It comes this
way&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;comes very fast. How loud sounds its rattle
on the paved path! The street is narrow, and I keep carefully to
the causeway. The carriage thunders past, but what do I see, or
fancy I see, as it rushes by? Surely something white fluttered from
that window&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;surely a hand waved a handkerchief.
Was that signal meant for me? Am I known? Who could recognise me?
That is not M. de Bassompierre's carriage, nor Mrs. Bretton's; and
besides, neither the H&Atilde;&acute;tel Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy nor the
ch&Atilde;&cent;teau of La Terrasse lies in that direction. Well, I
have no time for conjecture; I must hurry home.</p>
<p id="id03460">Gaining the Rue Fossette, reaching the pensionnat,
all there was still; no fiacre had yet arrived with Madame and
D&Atilde;&copy;sir&Atilde;&copy;e. I had left the great door ajar;
should I find it thus? Perhaps the wind or some other accident may
have thrown it to with sufficient force to start the spring-bolt?
In that case, hopeless became admission; my adventure must issue in
catastrophe. I lightly pushed the heavy leaf; would it yield?</p>
<p id="id03461">Yes. As soundless, as unresisting, as if some
propitious genius had waited on a sesame-charm, in the vestibule
within. Entering with bated breath, quietly making all fast,
shoelessly mounting the staircase, I sought the dormitory, and
reached my couch.</p>
<p id="id03462">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03463">Ay! I reached it, and once more drew a free
inspiration. The next moment, I almost
shrieked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost, but not quite, thank
Heaven!</p>
<p id="id03464">Throughout the dormitory, throughout the house,
there reigned at this hour the stillness of death. All slept, and
in such hush, it seemed that none dreamed. Stretched on the
nineteen beds lay nineteen forms, at full-length and motionless. On
mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the twentieth
couch&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nothing <i>ought</i> to have lain: I had
left it void, and void should have found it. What, then; do I see
between the half-drawn curtains? What dark, usurping shape, supine,
long, and strange? Is it a robber who has made his way through the
open street-door, and lies there in wait? It looks very black, I
think it looks&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not human. Can it be a wandering
dog that has come in from the street and crept and nestled hither?
Will it spring, will it leap out if I approach? Approach I must.
Courage! One step!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03465">My head reeled, for by the faint night-lamp, I saw
stretched on my bed the old phantom&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the NUN.</p>
<p id="id03466">A cry at this moment might have ruined me. Be the
spectacle what it might, I could afford neither consternation,
scream, nor swoon. Besides, I was not overcome. Tempered by late
incidents, my nerves disdained hysteria. Warm from illuminations,
and music, and thronging thousands, thoroughly lashed up by a new
scourge, I defied spectra. In a moment, without exclamation, I had
rushed on the haunted couch; nothing leaped out, or sprung, or
stirred; all the movement was mine, so was all the life, the
reality, the substance, the force; as my instinct felt. I tore her
up&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the incubus! I held her on
high&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the goblin! I shook her
loose&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the mystery! And down she
fell&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;down all around me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;down
in shreds and fragments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I trode upon
her.</p>
<p id="id03467">Here again&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;behold the branchless
tree, the unstabled Rosinante; the film of cloud, the flicker of
moonshine. The long nun proved a long bolster dressed in a long
black stole, and artfully invested with a white veil. The garments
in very truth, strange as it may seem, were genuine nun's garments,
and by some hand they had been disposed with a view to illusion.
Whence came these vestments? Who contrived this artifice? These
questions still remained. To the head-bandage was pinned a slip of
paper: it bore in pencil these mocking
words&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03468">"The nun of the attic bequeaths to Lucy Snowe her
wardrobe. She will be seen in the Rue Fossette no more."</p>
<p id="id03469">And what and who was she that had haunted me? She,
I had actually seen three times. Not a woman of my acquaintance had
the stature of that ghost. She was not of a female height. Not to
any man I knew could the machination, for a moment, be
attributed.</p>
<p id="id03470">Still mystified beyond expression, but as
thoroughly, as suddenly, relieved from all sense of the spectral
and unearthly; scorning also to wear out my brain with the fret of
a trivial though insoluble riddle, I just bundled together stole,
veil, and bandages, thrust them beneath my pillow, lay down,
listened till I heard the wheels of Madame's home-returning fiacre,
then turned, and worn out by many nights' vigils, conquered, too,
perhaps, by the now reacting narcotic, I deeply slept.</p>
<h2 id="id03471" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<h5 id="id03472">THE HAPPY PAIR.</h5>
<p id="id03473" style="margin-top: 2em">The day succeeding this
remarkable Midsummer night, proved no common day. I do not mean
that it brought signs in heaven above, or portents on the earth
beneath; nor do I allude to meteorological phenomena, to storm,
flood, or whirlwind. On the contrary: the sun rose jocund, with a
July face. Morning decked her beauty with rubies, and so filled her
lap with roses, that they fell from her in showers, making her path
blush: the Hours woke fresh as nymphs, and emptying on the early
hills their dew-vials, they stepped out dismantled of vapour:
shadowless, azure, and glorious, they led the sun's steeds on a
burning and unclouded course.</p>
<p id="id03474">In short, it was as fine a day as the finest summer
could boast; but I doubt whether I was not the sole inhabitant of
the Rue Fossette, who cared or remembered to note this pleasant
fact. Another thought busied all other heads; a thought, indeed,
which had its share in my meditations; but this master
consideration, not possessing for me so entire a novelty, so
overwhelming a suddenness, especially so dense a mystery, as it
offered to the majority of my co-speculators thereon, left me
somewhat more open than the rest to any collateral observation or
impression.</p>
<p id="id03475">Still, while walking in the garden, feeling the
sunshine, and marking the blooming and growing plants, I pondered
the same subject the whole house discussed.</p>
<p id="id03476">What subject?</p>
<p id="id03477">Merely this. When matins came to be said, there was
a place vacant in the first rank of boarders. When breakfast was
served, there remained a coffee-cup unclaimed. When the housemaid
made the beds, she found in one, a bolster laid lengthwise, clad in
a cap and night-gown; and when Ginevra Fanshawe's music-mistress
came early, as usual, to give the morning lesson, that accomplished
and promising young person, her pupil, failed utterly to be
forthcoming.</p>
<p id="id03478">High and low was Miss Fanshawe sought; through
length and breadth was the house ransacked; vainly; not a trace,
not an indication, not so much as a scrap of a billet rewarded the
search; the nymph was vanished, engulfed in the past night, like a
shooting star swallowed up by darkness.</p>
<p id="id03479">Deep was the dismay of surveillante teachers,
deeper the horror of the defaulting directress. Never had I seen
Madame Beck so pale or so appalled. Here was a blow struck at her
tender part, her weak side; here was damage done to her interest.
How, too, had the untoward event happened? By what outlet had the
fugitive taken wing? Not a casement was found unfastened, not a
pane of glass broken; all the doors were bolted secure. Never to
this day has Madame Beck obtained satisfaction on this point, nor
indeed has anybody else concerned, save and excepting one, Lucy
Snowe, who could not forget how, to facilitate a certain
enterprise, a certain great door had been drawn softly to its
lintel, closed, indeed, but neither bolted nor secure. The
thundering carriage-and-pair encountered were now likewise
recalled, as well as that puzzling signal, the waved
handkerchief.</p>
<p id="id03480">From these premises, and one or two others,
inaccessible to any but myself, I could draw but one inference. It
was a case of elopement. Morally certain on this head, and seeing
Madame Beck's profound embarrassment, I at last communicated my
conviction. Having alluded to M. de Hamal's suit, I found, as I
expected, that Madame Beck was perfectly au fait to that affair.
She had long since discussed it with Mrs. Cholmondeley, and laid
her own responsibility in the business on that lady's shoulders. To
Mrs. Cholmondeley and M. de Bassompierre she now had recourse.</p>
<p id="id03481">We found that the H&Atilde;&acute;tel
Cr&Atilde;&copy;cy was already alive to what had happened. Ginevra
had written to her cousin Paulina, vaguely signifying hymeneal
intentions; communications had been received from the family of de
Hamal; M. de Bassompierre was on the track of the fugitives. He
overtook them too late.</p>
<p id="id03482">In the course of the week, the post brought me a
note. I may as well transcribe it; it contains explanation on more
than one point:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03483">'DEAR OLD TIM "(short for
Timon),&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;" I am off you
see&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;gone like a shot. Alfred and I intended to
be married in this way almost from the first; we never meant to be
spliced in the humdrum way of other people; Alfred has too much
spirit for that, and so have I&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Dieu merci! Do
you know, Alfred, who used to call you 'the dragon,' has seen so
much of you during the last few months, that he begins to feel
quite friendly towards you. He hopes you won't miss him now that he
has gone; he begs to apologize for any little trouble he may have
given you. He is afraid he rather inconvenienced you once when he
came upon you in the grenier, just as you were reading a letter
seemingly of the most special interest; but he could not resist the
temptation to give you a start, you appeared so wonderfully taken
up with your correspondent. En revanche, he says you once
frightened him by rushing in for a dress or a shawl, or some other
chiffon, at the moment when he had struck a light, and was going to
take a quiet whiff of his cigar, while waiting for me.</p>
<p id="id03484">"Do you begin to comprehend by this time that M. le
Comte de Hamal was the nun of the attic, and that he came to see
your humble servant? I will tell you how he managed it. You know he
has the entr&Atilde;&copy;e of the
Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e, where two or three of his
nephews, the sons of his eldest sister, Madame de Melcy, are
students. You know the court of the
Ath&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;e is on the other side of the high
wall bounding your walk, the all&Atilde;&copy;e
d&Atilde;&copy;fendue. Alfred can climb as well as he can dance or
fence: his amusement was to make the escalade of our pensionnat by
mounting, first the wall; then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;by the aid of
that high tree overspreading the grand berceau, and resting some of
its boughs on the roof of the lower buildings of our
premises&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he managed to scale the first classe
and the grand salle. One night, by the way, he fell out of this
tree, tore down some of the branches, nearly broke his own neck,
and after all, in running away, got a terrible fright, and was
nearly caught by two people, Madame Beck and M. Emanuel, he thinks,
walking in the alley. From the grande salle the ascent is not
difficult to the highest block of building, finishing in the great
garret. The skylight, you know, is, day and night, left half open
for air; by the skylight he entered. Nearly a year ago I chanced to
tell him our legend of the nun; that suggested his romantic idea of
the spectral disguise, which I think you must allow he has very
cleverly carried out.</p>
<p id="id03485">"But for the nun's black gown and white veil, he
would have been caught again and again both by you and that
tiger-Jesuit, M. Paul. He thinks you both capital ghost-seers, and
very brave. What I wonder at is, rather your secretiveness than
your courage. How could you endure the visitations of that long
spectre, time after time, without crying out, telling everybody,
and rousing the whole house and neighbourhood?</p>
<p id="id03486">"Oh, and how did you like the nun as a bed-fellow?
<i>I</i> dressed her up: didn't I do it well? Did you shriek when
you saw her: I should have gone mad; but then you have such
nerves!&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;real iron and bend-leather! I believe
you feel nothing. You haven't the same sensitiveness that a person
of my constitution has. You seem to me insensible both to pain and
fear and grief. You are a real old Diogenes.</p>
<p id="id03487">"Well, dear grandmother! and are you not mightily
angry at my moonlight flitting and run away match? I assure you it
is excellent fun, and I did it partly to spite that minx, Paulina,
and that bear, Dr. John: to show them that, with all their airs, I
could get married as well as they. M. de Bassompierre was at first
in a strange fume with Alfred; he threatened a prosecution for
'd&Atilde;&copy;tournement de mineur,' and I know not what; he was
so abominably in earnest, that I found myself forced to do a little
bit of the melodramatic&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;go down on my knees,
sob, cry, drench three pocket-handkerchiefs. Of course, 'mon oncle'
soon gave in; indeed, where was the use of making a fuss? I am
married, and that's all about it. He still says our marriage is not
legal, because I am not of age, forsooth! As if that made any
difference! I am just as much married as if I were a hundred.
However, we are to be married again, and I am to have a trousseau,
and Mrs. Cholmondeley is going to superintend it; and there are
some hopes that M. de Bassompierre will give me a decent portion,
which will be very convenient, as dear Alfred has nothing but his
nobility, native and hereditary, and his pay. I only wish uncle
would do things unconditionally, in a generous, gentleman-like
fashion; he is so disagreeable as to make the dowry depend on
Alfred's giving his written promise that he will never touch cards
or dice from the day it is paid down. They accuse my angel of a
tendency to play: I don't know anything about that, but I <i>do</i>
know he is a dear, adorable creature.</p>
<p id="id03488">"I cannot sufficiently extol the genius with which
de Hamal managed our flight. How clever in him to select the night
of the f&Atilde;&ordf;te, when Madame (for he knows her habits), as
he said, would infallibly be absent at the concert in the park. I
suppose <i>you</i> must have gone with her. I watched you rise and
leave the dormitory about eleven o'clock. How you returned alone,
and on foot, I cannot conjecture. That surely was <i>you</i> we met
in the narrow old Rue St. Jean? Did you see me wave my handkerchief
from the carriage window?</p>
<p id="id03489">"Adieu! Rejoice in my good luck: congratulate me on
my supreme happiness, and believe me, dear cynic and misanthrope,
yours, in the best of health and spirits,</p>
<p id="id03490">GINEVRA LAURA DE HAMAL, n&Atilde;&copy;e
FANSHAWE.</p>
<p id="id03491">"P.S.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Remember, I am a countess
now. Papa, mamma, and the girls at home, will be delighted to hear
that. 'My daughter the Countess!' 'My sister the Countess!' Bravo!
Sounds rather better than Mrs. John Bretton, hein?"</p>
<p id="id03492">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03493">In winding up Mistress Fanshawe's memoirs, the
reader will no doubt expect to hear that she came finally to bitter
expiation of her youthful levities. Of course, a large share of
suffering lies in reserve for her future.</p>
<p id="id03494">A few words will embody my farther knowledge
respecting her.</p>
<p id="id03495">I saw her towards the close of her honeymoon. She
called on Madame Beck, and sent for me into the salon. She rushed
into my arms laughing. She looked very blooming and beautiful: her
curls were longer, her cheeks rosier than ever: her white bonnet
and her Flanders veil, her orange-flowers and her bride's dress,
became her mightily.</p>
<p id="id03496">"I have got my portion!" she cried at once;
(Ginevra ever stuck to the substantial; I always thought there was
a good trading element in her composition, much as she scorned the
"bourgeoise;") "and uncle de Bassompierre is quite reconciled. I
don't mind his calling Alfred a
'nincompoop'&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that's only his coarse Scotch
breeding; and I believe Paulina envies me, and Dr. John is wild
with jealousy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fit to blow his brains
out&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and I'm so happy! I really think I've hardly
anything left to wish for&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;unless it be a
carriage and an hotel, and, oh! I&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;must introduce
you to 'mon mari.' Alfred, come here!"</p>
<p id="id03497">And Alfred appeared from the inner salon, where he
was talking to Madame Beck, receiving the blended felicitations and
reprimands of that lady. I was presented under my various names:
the Dragon, Diogenes, and Timon. The young Colonel was very polite.
He made me a prettily-turned, neatly-worded apology, about the
ghost-visits, &amp;c., concluding with saying that "the best excuse
for all his iniquities stood there!" pointing to his bride.</p>
<p id="id03498">And then the bride sent him back to Madame Beck,
and she took me to herself, and proceeded literally to suffocate me
with her unrestrained spirits, her girlish, giddy, wild nonsense.
She showed her ring exultingly; she called herself Madame la
Comtesse de Hamal, and asked how it sounded, a score of times. I
said very little. I gave her only the crust and rind of my nature.
No matter she expected of me nothing better&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;she
knew me too well to look for compliments&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my dry
gibes pleased her well enough and the more impassible and prosaic
my mien, the more merrily she laughed.</p>
<p id="id03499">Soon after his marriage, M. de Hamal was persuaded
to leave the army as the surest way of weaning him from certain
unprofitable associates and habits; a post of attach&Atilde;&copy;
was procured for him, and he and his young wife went abroad. I
thought she would forget me now, but she did not. For many years,
she kept up a capricious, fitful sort of correspondence. During the
first year or two, it was only of herself and Alfred she wrote;
then, Alfred faded in the background; herself and a certain, new
comer prevailed; one Alfred Fanshawe de Bassompierre de Hamal began
to reign in his father's stead. There were great boastings about
this personage, extravagant amplifications upon miracles of
precocity, mixed with vehement objurgations against the phlegmatic
incredulity with which I received them. I didn't know "what it was
to be a mother;" "unfeeling thing that I was, the sensibilities of
the maternal heart were Greek and Hebrew to me," and so on. In due
course of nature this young gentleman took his degrees in teething,
measles, hooping-cough: that was a terrible time for
me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the mamma's letters became a perfect shout of
affliction; never woman was so put upon by calamity: never human
being stood in such need of sympathy. I was frightened at first,
and wrote back pathetically; but I soon found out there was more
cry than wool in the business, and relapsed into my natural cruel
insensibility. As to the youthful sufferer, he weathered each storm
like a hero. Five times was that youth "in articulo mortis," and
five times did he miraculously revive.</p>
<p id="id03500">In the course of years there arose ominous
murmurings against Alfred the First; M. de Bassompierre had to be
appealed to, debts had to be paid, some of them of that dismal and
dingy order called "debts of honour;" ignoble plaints and
difficulties became frequent. Under every cloud, no matter what its
nature, Ginevra, as of old, called out lustily for sympathy and
aid. She had no notion of meeting any distress single-handed. In
some shape, from some quarter or other, she was pretty sure to
obtain her will, and so she got on&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;fighting the
battle of life by proxy, and, on the whole, suffering as little as
any human being I have ever known.</p>
<h2 id="id03501" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<h5 id="id03502">FAUBOURG CLOTILDE.</h5>
<p id="id03503" style="margin-top: 2em">Must I, ere I close, render
some account of that Freedom and Renovation which I won on the
f&Atilde;&ordf;te-night? Must I tell how I and the two stalwart
companions I brought home from the illuminated park bore the test
of intimate acquaintance?</p>
<p id="id03504">I tried them the very next day. They had boasted
their strength loudly when they reclaimed me from love and its
bondage, but upon my demanding deeds, not words, some evidence of
better comfort, some experience of a relieved
life&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Freedom excused himself, as for the present
impoverished and disabled to assist; and Renovation never spoke; he
had died in the night suddenly.</p>
<p id="id03505">I had nothing left for it then but to trust
secretly that conjecture might have hurried me too fast and too
far, to sustain the oppressive hour by reminders of the distorting
and discolouring magic of jealousy. After a short and vain
struggle, I found myself brought back captive to the old rack of
suspense, tied down and strained anew.</p>
<p id="id03506">Shall I yet see him before he goes? Will he bear me
in mind? Does he purpose to come? Will this
day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;will the next hour bring him? or must I
again assay that corroding pain of long
attent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that rude agony of rupture at the close,
that mute, mortal wrench, which, in at once uprooting hope and
doubt, shakes life; while the hand that does the violence cannot be
caressed to pity, because absence interposes her barrier!</p>
<p id="id03507">It was the Feast of the Assumption; no school was
held. The boarders and teachers, after attending mass in the
morning, were gone a long walk into the country to take their
go&Atilde;&raquo;ter, or afternoon meal, at some farm-house. I did
not go with them, for now but two days remained ere the <i>Paul et
Virginie</i> must sail, and I was clinging to my last chance, as
the living waif of a wreck clings to his last raft or cable.</p>
<p id="id03508">There was some joiners' work to do in the first
classe, some bench or desk to repair; holidays were often turned to
account for the performance of these operations, which could not be
executed when the rooms were filled with pupils. As I sat solitary,
purposing to adjourn to the garden and leave the coast clear, but
too listless to fulfil my own intent, I heard the workmen
coming.</p>
<p id="id03509">Foreign artisans and servants do everything by
couples: I believe it would take two Labassecourien carpenters to
drive a nail. While tying on my bonnet, which had hitherto hung by
its ribbons from my idle hand, I vaguely and momentarily wondered
to hear the step of but one "ouvrier." I noted,
too&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as captives in dungeons find sometimes
dreary leisure to note the merest trifles&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
this man wore shoes, and not sabots: I concluded that it must be
the master-carpenter, coming to inspect before he sent his
journeymen. I threw round me my scarf. He advanced; he opened the
door; my back was towards it; I felt a little
thrill&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a curious sensation, too quick and
transient to be analyzed. I turned, I stood in the supposed
master-artisan's presence: looking towards the door-way, I saw it
filled with a figure, and my eyes printed upon my brain the picture
of M. Paul.</p>
<p id="id03510">Hundreds of the prayers with which we weary Heaven
bring to the suppliant no fulfilment. Once haply in life, one
golden gift falls prone in the lap&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one boon full
and bright, perfect from Fruition's mint.</p>
<p id="id03511">M. Emanuel wore the dress in which he probably
purposed to travel&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a surtout, guarded with
velvet; I thought him prepared for instant departure, and yet I had
understood that two days were yet to run before the ship sailed. He
looked well and cheerful. He looked kind and benign: he came in
with eagerness; he was close to me in one second; he was all amity.
It might be his bridegroom mood which thus brightened him. Whatever
the cause, I could not meet his sunshine with cloud. If this were
my last moment with him, I would not waste it in forced, unnatural
distance. I loved him well&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;too well not to smite
out of my path even Jealousy herself, when she would have
obstructed a kind farewell. A cordial word from his lips, or a
gentle look from his eyes, would do me good, for all the span of
life that remained to me; it would be comfort in the last strait of
loneliness; I would take it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I would taste the
elixir, and pride should not spill the cup.</p>
<p id="id03512">The interview would be short, of course: he would
say to me just what he had said to each of the assembled pupils; he
would take and hold my hand two minutes; he would touch my cheek
with his lips for the first, last, only time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
then&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no more. Then, indeed, the final parting,
then the wide separation, the great gulf I could not pass to go to
him&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;across which, haply, he would not glance, to
remember me.</p>
<p id="id03513">He took my hand in one of his, with the other he
put back my bonnet; he looked into my face, his luminous smile went
out, his lips expressed something almost like the wordless language
of a mother who finds a child greatly and unexpectedly changed,
broken with illness, or worn out by want. A check supervened.</p>
<p id="id03514">"Paul, Paul!" said a woman's hurried voice behind,
"Paul, come into the salon; I have yet a great many things to say
to you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;conversation for the whole
day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and so has Victor; and Josef is here. Come
Paul, come to your friends."</p>
<p id="id03515">Madame Beck, brought to the spot by vigilance or an
inscrutable instinct, pressed so near, she almost thrust herself
between me and M. Emanuel.</p>
<p id="id03516">"Come, Paul!" she reiterated, her eye grazing me
with its hard ray like a steel stylet. She pushed against her
kinsman. I thought he receded; I thought he would go. Pierced
deeper than I could endure, made now to feel what defied
suppression, I cried&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03517">"My heart will break!"</p>
<p id="id03518">What I felt seemed literal heart-break; but the
seal of another fountain yielded under the strain: one breath from
M. Paul, the whisper, "Trust me!" lifted a load, opened an outlet.
With many a deep sob, with thrilling, with icy shiver, with strong
trembling, and yet with relief&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I wept.</p>
<p id="id03519">"Leave her to me; it is a crisis: I will give her a
cordial, and it will pass," said the calm Madame Beck.</p>
<p id="id03520">To be left to her and her cordial seemed to me
something like being left to the poisoner and her bowl. When M.
Paul answered deeply, harshly, and
briefly&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"Laissez-moi!" in the grim sound I felt
a music strange, strong, but life-giving.</p>
<p id="id03521">"Laissez-moi!" he repeated, his nostrils opening,
and his facial muscles all quivering as he spoke.</p>
<p id="id03522">"But this will never do," said Madame, with
sternness. More sternly rejoined her
kinsman&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03523">"Sortez d'ici!"</p>
<p id="id03524">"I will send for P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas: on the
spot I will send for him," she threatened pertinaciously.</p>
<p id="id03525">"Femme!" cried the Professor, not now in his deep
tones, but in his highest and most excited key, "Femme! sortez
&Atilde;&nbsp; l'instant!"</p>
<p id="id03526">He was roused, and I loved him in his wrath with a
passion beyond what<br />
I had yet felt.<br /></p>
<p id="id03527">"What you do is wrong," pursued Madame; "it is an
act characteristic of men of your unreliable, imaginative
temperament; a step impulsive, injudicious,
inconsistent&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a proceeding vexatious, and not
estimable in the view of persons of steadier and more resolute
character."</p>
<p id="id03528">"You know not what I have of steady and resolute in
me," said he, "but you shall see; the event shall teach you.
Modeste," he continued less fiercely, "be gentle, be pitying, be a
woman; look at this poor face, and relent. You know I am your
friend, and the friend of your friends; in spite of your taunts,
you well and deeply know I may be trusted. Of sacrificing myself I
made no difficulty but my heart is pained by what I see; it
<i>must</i> have and give solace. <i>Leave me!</i>"</p>
<p id="id03529">This time, in the "<i>leave me</i>" there was an
intonation so bitter and so imperative, I wondered that even Madame
Beck herself could for one moment delay obedience; but she stood
firm; she gazed upon him dauntless; she met his eye, forbidding and
fixed as stone. She was opening her lips to retort; I saw over all
M. Paul's face a quick rising light and fire; I can hardly tell how
he managed the movement; it did not seem violent; it kept the form
of courtesy; he gave his hand; it scarce touched her I thought; she
ran, she whirled from the room; she was gone, and the door shut, in
one second.</p>
<p id="id03530">The flash of passion was all over very soon. He
smiled as he told me to wipe my eyes; he waited quietly till I was
calm, dropping from time to time a stilling, solacing word. Ere
long I sat beside him once more
myself&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;re-assured, not desperate, nor yet
desolate; not friendless, not hopeless, not sick of life, and
seeking death.</p>
<p id="id03531">"It made you very sad then to lose your friend?"
said he.</p>
<p id="id03532">"It kills me to be forgotten, Monsieur," I said.
"All these weary days I have not heard from you one word, and I was
crushed with the possibility, growing to certainty, that you would
depart without saying farewell!"</p>
<p id="id03533">"Must I tell you what I told Modeste
Beck&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that you do not know me? Must I show and
teach you my character? You <i>will</i> have proof that I can be a
firm friend? Without clear proof this hand will not lie still in
mine, it will not trust my shoulder as a safe stay? Good. The proof
is ready. I come to justify myself."</p>
<p id="id03534">"Say anything, teach anything, prove anything,
Monsieur; I can listen now."</p>
<p id="id03535">"Then, in the first place, you must go out with me
a good distance into the town. I came on purpose to fetch you."</p>
<p id="id03536">Without questioning his meaning, or sounding his
plan, or offering the semblance of an objection, I re-tied my
bonnet: I was ready.</p>
<p id="id03537">The route he took was by the boulevards: he several
times made me sit down on the seats stationed under the lime-trees;
he did not ask if I was tired, but looked, and drew his own
conclusions.</p>
<p id="id03538">"All these weary days," said he, repeating my
words, with a gentle, kindly mimicry of my voice and foreign
accent, not new from his lips, and of which the playful banter
never wounded, not even when coupled, as it often was, with the
assertion, that however I might <i>write</i> his language, I
<i>spoke</i> and always should speak it imperfectly and
hesitatingly. "'All these weary days' I have not for one hour
forgotten you. Faithful women err in this, that they think
themselves the sole faithful of God's creatures. On a very fervent
and living truth to myself, I, too, till lately scarce dared count,
from any quarter; but&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;look
at me.",</p>
<p id="id03539">I lifted my happy eyes: they <i>were</i> happy now,
or they would have been no interpreters of my heart.</p>
<p id="id03540">"Well," said he, after some seconds' scrutiny,
"there is no denying that signature: Constancy wrote it: her pen is
of iron. Was the record painful?"</p>
<p id="id03541">"Severely painful," I said, with truth. "Withdraw
her hand, Monsieur; I can bear its inscribing force no more."</p>
<p id="id03542">"Elle est toute p&Atilde;&cent;le," said he,
speaking to himself; "cette figure-l&Atilde;&nbsp; me fait
mal."</p>
<p id="id03543">"Ah! I am not pleasant to look
at&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id03544">I could not help saying this; the words came
unbidden: I never remember the time when I had not a haunting dread
of what might be the degree of my outward deficiency; this dread
pressed me at the moment with special force.</p>
<p id="id03545">A great softness passed upon his countenance; his
violet eyes grew suffused and glistening under their deep Spanish
lashes: he started up; "Let us walk on."</p>
<p id="id03546">"Do I displease your eyes <i>much</i>?" I took
courage to urge: the point had its vital import for me.</p>
<p id="id03547">He stopped, and gave me a short, strong answer; an
answer which silenced, subdued, yet profoundly satisfied. Ever
after that I knew what I was for <i>him</i>; and what I might be
for the rest of the world, I ceased painfully to care. Was it weak
to lay so much stress on an opinion about appearance? I fear it
might be; I fear it was; but in that case I must avow no light
share of weakness. I must own great fear of
displeasing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a strong wish moderately to please
M. Paul.</p>
<p id="id03548">Whither we rambled, I scarce knew. Our walk was
long, yet seemed short; the path was pleasant, the day lovely. M.
Emanuel talked of his voyage&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he thought of
staying away three years. On his return from Guadaloupe, he looked
forward to release from liabilities and a clear course; and what
did I purpose doing in the interval of his absence? he asked. I had
talked once, he reminded me, of trying to be independent and
keeping a little school of my own: had I dropped the idea?</p>
<p id="id03549">"Indeed, I had not: I was doing my best to save
what would enable me to put it in practice."</p>
<p id="id03550">"He did not like leaving me in the Rue Fossette; he
feared I should miss him there too much&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I should
feel desolate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I should grow
sad&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;?"</p>
<p id="id03551">This was certain; but I promised to do my best to
endure.</p>
<p id="id03552">"Still," said he, speaking low, "there is another
objection to your present residence. I should wish to write to you
sometimes: it would not be well to have any uncertainty about the
safe transmission of letters; and in the Rue
Fossette&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in short, our Catholic discipline in
certain matters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;though justifiable and
expedient&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;might possibly, under peculiar
circumstances, become liable to
misapplication&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;perhaps abuse."</p>
<p id="id03553">"But if you write," said I, "I <i>must</i> have
your letters; and I <i>will</i> have them: ten directors, twenty
directresses, shall not keep them from me. I am a Protestant: I
will not bear that kind of discipline: Monsieur, I <i>will
not</i>."</p>
<p id="id03554">"Doucement&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;doucement," rejoined
he; "we will contrive a plan; we have our resources: soyez
tranquille."</p>
<p id="id03555">So speaking, he paused.</p>
<p id="id03556">We were now returning from the long walk. We had
reached the middle of a clean Faubourg, where the houses were
small, but looked pleasant. It was before the white door-step of a
very neat abode that M. Paul had halted.</p>
<p id="id03557">"I call here," said he.</p>
<p id="id03558">He did not knock, but taking from his pocket a key,
he opened and entered at once. Ushering me in, he shut the door
behind us. No servant appeared. The vestibule was small, like the
house, but freshly and tastefully painted; its vista closed in a
French window with vines trained about the panes, tendrils, and
green leaves kissing the glass. Silence reigned in this
dwelling.</p>
<p id="id03559">Opening an inner door, M. Paul disclosed a parlour,
or salon&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;very tiny, but I thought, very pretty.
Its delicate walls were tinged like a blush; its floor was waxed; a
square of brilliant carpet covered its centre; its small round
table shone like the mirror over its hearth; there was a little
couch, a little chiffonni&Atilde;&uml;re, the half-open,
crimson-silk door of which, showed porcelain on the shelves; there
was a French clock, a lamp; there were ornaments in biscuit china;
the recess of the single ample window was filled with a green
stand, bearing three green flower-pots, each filled with a fine
plant glowing in bloom; in one corner appeared a
gu&Atilde;&copy;ridon with a marble top, and upon it a work-box,
and a glass filled with violets in water. The lattice of this room
was open; the outer air breathing through, gave freshness, the
sweet violets lent fragrance.</p>
<p id="id03560">"Pretty, pretty place!" said I. M. Paul smiled to
see me so pleased.</p>
<p id="id03561">"Must we sit down here and wait?" I asked in a
whisper, half awed by the deep pervading hush.</p>
<p id="id03562">"We will first peep into one or two other nooks of
this nutshell," he replied.</p>
<p id="id03563">"Dare you take the freedom of going all over the
house?" I inquired.</p>
<p id="id03564">"Yes, I dare," said he, quietly.</p>
<p id="id03565">He led the way. I was shown a little kitchen with a
little stove and oven, with few but bright brasses, two chairs and
a table. A small cupboard held a diminutive but commodious set of
earthenware.</p>
<p id="id03566">"There is a coffee service of china in the salon,"
said M. Paul, as I looked at the six green and white dinner-plates;
the four dishes, the cups and jugs to match.</p>
<p id="id03567">Conducted up the narrow but clean staircase, I was
permitted a glimpse of two pretty cabinets of sleeping-rooms;
finally, I was once more led below, and we halted with a certain
ceremony before a larger door than had yet been opened.</p>
<p id="id03568">Producing a second key, M. Emanuel adjusted it to
the lock of this door. He opened, put me in before him.</p>
<p id="id03569">"Voici!" he cried.</p>
<p id="id03570">I found myself in a good-sized apartment,
scrupulously clean, though bare, compared with those I had hitherto
seen. The well-scoured boards were carpetless; it contained two
rows of green benches and desks, with an alley down the centre,
terminating in an estrade, a teacher's chair and table; behind them
a tableau, On the walls hung two maps; in the windows flowered a
few hardy plants; in short, here was a miniature
classe&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;complete, neat, pleasant.</p>
<p id="id03571">"It is a school then?" said I. "Who keeps it? I
never heard of an establishment in this faubourg."</p>
<p id="id03572">"Will you have the goodness to accept of a few
prospectuses for distribution in behalf of a friend of mine?" asked
he, taking from his surtout-pocket some quires of these documents,
and putting them into my hand. I looked, I
read&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;printed in fair
characters:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03573">"Externat de demoiselles. Num&Atilde;&copy;ro 7,
Faubourg Clotilde, Directrice,<br />
Mademoiselle Lucy Snowe."<br /></p>
<p id="id03574">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03575">And what did I say to M. Paul Emanuel?</p>
<p id="id03576">Certain junctures of our lives must always be
difficult of recall to memory. Certain points, crises, certain
feelings, joys, griefs, and amazements, when reviewed, must strike
us as things wildered and whirling, dim as a wheel fast spun.</p>
<p id="id03577">I can no more remember the thoughts or the words of
the ten minutes succeeding this disclosure, than I can retrace the
experience of my earliest year of life: and yet the first thing
distinct to me is the consciousness that I was speaking very fast,
repeating over and over again:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03578">"Did you do this, M. Paul? Is this your house? Did
you furnish it? Did you get these papers printed? Do you mean me?
Am I the directress? Is there another Lucy Snowe? Tell me: say
something."</p>
<p id="id03579">But he would not speak. His pleased silence, his
laughing down-look, his attitude, are visible to me now.</p>
<p id="id03580">"How is it? I must know
all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<i>all</i>," I cried.</p>
<p id="id03581">The packet of papers fell on the floor. He had
extended his hand, and I had fastened thereon, oblivious of all
else.</p>
<p id="id03582">"Ah! you said I had forgotten you all these weary
days," said he. "Poor old Emanuel! These are the thanks he gets for
trudging about three mortal weeks from house-painter to
upholsterer, from cabinet-maker to charwoman. Lucy and Lucy's cot,
the sole thoughts in his head!"</p>
<p id="id03583">I hardly knew what to do. I first caressed the soft
velvet on his cuff, and then. I stroked the hand it surrounded. It
was his foresight, his goodness, his silent, strong, effective
goodness, that overpowered me by their proved reality. It was the
assurance of his sleepless interest which broke on me like a light
from heaven; it was his&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I will dare to say
it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his fond, tender look, which now shook me
indescribably. In the midst of all I forced myself to look at the
practical.</p>
<p id="id03584">"The trouble!" I cried, "and the cost! Had you
money, M. Paul?"</p>
<p id="id03585">"Plenty of money!" said he heartily. "The disposal
of my large teaching connection put me in possession of a handsome
sum with part of it I determined to give myself the richest treat
that I <i>have</i> known or <i>shall</i> know. I like this. I have
reckoned on this hour day and night lately. I would not come near
you, because I would not forestall it. Reserve is neither my virtue
nor my vice. If I had put myself into your power, and you had begun
with your questions of look and lip&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Where have
you been, M. Paul? What have you been doing? What is your
mystery?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;my solitary first and last secret would
presently have unravelled itself in your lap. Now," he pursued,
"you shall live here and have a school; you shall employ yourself
while I am away; you shall think of me sometimes; you shall mind
your health and happiness for my sake, and when I come
back&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"</p>
<p id="id03586">There he left a blank.</p>
<p id="id03587">I promised to do all he told me. I promised to work
hard and willingly. "I will be your faithful steward," I said; "I
trust at your coming the account will be ready. Monsieur, monsieur,
you are <i>too</i> good!"</p>
<p id="id03588">In such inadequate language my feelings struggled
for expression: they could not get it; speech, brittle and
unmalleable, and cold as ice, dissolved or shivered in the effort.
He watched me, still; he gently raised his hand to stroke my hair;
it touched my lips in passing; I pressed it close, I paid it
tribute. He was my king; royal for me had been that hand's bounty;
to offer homage was both a joy and a duty.</p>
<p id="id03589">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03590">The afternoon hours were over, and the stiller time
of evening shaded the quiet faubourg. M. Paul claimed my
hospitality; occupied and afoot since morning, he needed
refreshment; he said I should offer him chocolate in my pretty gold
and white china service. He went out and ordered what was needful
from the restaurant; he placed the small gu&Atilde;&copy;ridon and
two chairs in the balcony outside the French window under the
screening vines. With what shy joy i accepted my part as hostess,
arranged the salver, served the benefactor-guest.</p>
<p id="id03591">This balcony was in the rear of the house, the
gardens of the faubourg were round us, fields extended beyond. The
air was still, mild, and fresh. Above the poplars, the laurels, the
cypresses, and the roses, looked up a moon so lovely and so
halcyon, the heart trembled under her smile; a star shone subject
beside her, with the unemulous ray of pure love. In a large garden
near us, a jet rose from a well, and a pale statue leaned over the
play of waters.</p>
<p id="id03592">M. Paul talked to me. His voice was so modulated
that it mixed harmonious with the silver whisper, the gush, the
musical sigh, in which light breeze, fountain and foliage intoned
their lulling vesper:</p>
<p id="id03593">Happy hour&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;stay one moment!
droop those plumes, rest those wings; incline to mine that brow of
Heaven! White Angel! let thy light linger; leave its reflection on
succeeding clouds; bequeath its cheer to that time which needs a
ray in retrospect!</p>
<p id="id03594">Our meal was simple: the chocolate, the rolls, the
plate of fresh summer fruit, cherries and strawberries bedded in
green leaves formed the whole: but it was what we both liked better
than a feast, and I took a delight inexpressible in tending M.
Paul. I asked him whether his friends, P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas and
Madame Beck, knew what he had done&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether they
had seen my house?</p>
<p id="id03595">"Mon amie," said he, "none knows what I have done
save you and myself: the pleasure is consecrated to us two,
unshared and unprofaned. To speak truth, there has been to me in
this matter a refinement of enjoyment I would not make vulgar by
communication. Besides" (smiling) "I wanted to prove to Miss Lucy
that I <i>could</i> keep a secret. How often has she taunted me
with lack of dignified reserve and needful caution! How many times
has she saucily insinuated that all my affairs are the secret of
Polichinelle!"</p>
<p id="id03596">This was true enough: I had not spared him on this
point, nor perhaps on any other that was assailable.
Magnificent-minded, grand-hearted, dear, faulty little man! You
deserved candour, and from me always had it.</p>
<p id="id03597">Continuing my queries, I asked to whom the house
belonged, who was my landlord, the amount of my rent. He instantly
gave me these particulars in writing; he had foreseen and prepared
all things.</p>
<p id="id03598">The house was not M. Paul's&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that
I guessed: he was hardly the man to become a proprietor; I more
than suspected in him a lamentable absence of the saving faculty;
he could get, but not keep; he needed a treasurer. The tenement,
then, belonged to a citizen in the Basse-Ville&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
man of substance, M. Paul said; he startled me by adding: "a friend
of yours, Miss Lucy, a person who has a most respectful regard for
you." And, to my pleasant surprise, I found the landlord was none
other than M. Miret, the short-tempered and kind-hearted
bookseller, who had so kindly found me a seat that eventful night
in the park. It seems M. Miret was, in his station, rich, as well
as much respected, and possessed several houses in this faubourg;
the rent was moderate, scarce half of what it would have been for a
house of equal size nearer the centre of Villette.</p>
<p id="id03599">"And then," observed M. Paul, "should fortune not
favour you, though I think she will, I have the satisfaction to
think you are in good hands; M. Miret will not be extortionate: the
first year's rent you have already in your savings; afterwards Miss
Lucy must trust God, and herself. But now, what will you do for
pupils?"</p>
<p id="id03600">"I must distribute my prospectuses."</p>
<p id="id03601">"Right! By way of losing no time, I gave one to M.
Miret yesterday.<br />
Should you object to beginning with three petite bourgeoises,
the<br />
Demoiselles Miret? They are at your service."<br /></p>
<p id="id03602">"Monsieur, you forget nothing; you are wonderful.
Object? It would become me indeed to object! I suppose I hardly
expect at the outset to number aristocrats in my little day-school;
I care not if they never come. I shall be proud to receive M.
Miret's daughters."</p>
<p id="id03603">"Besides these," pursued he, "another pupil offers,
who will come daily to take lessons in English; and as she is rich,
she will pay handsomely. I mean my god-daughter and ward, Justine
Marie Sauveur."</p>
<p id="id03604">What is in a name?&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what in three
words? Till this moment I had listened with living
joy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I had answered with gleeful quickness; a
name froze me; three words struck me mute. The effect could not be
hidden, and indeed I scarce tried to hide it.</p>
<p id="id03605">"What now?" said M. Paul.</p>
<p id="id03606">"Nothing."</p>
<p id="id03607">"Nothing! Your countenance changes: your colour and
your very eyes fade. Nothing! You must be ill; you have some
suffering; tell me what."</p>
<p id="id03608">I had nothing to tell.</p>
<p id="id03609">He drew his chair nearer. He did not grow vexed,
though I continued silent and icy. He tried to win a word; he
entreated with perseverance, he waited with patience.</p>
<p id="id03610">"Justine Marie is a good girl," said he, "docile
and amiable; not quick&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but you will like
her."</p>
<p id="id03611">"I think not. I think she must not come here."</p>
<p id="id03612">Such was my speech.</p>
<p id="id03613">"Do you wish to puzzle me? Do you know her? But, in
truth, there <i>is</i> something. Again you are pale as that
statue. Rely on Paul Carlos; tell him the grief."</p>
<p id="id03614">His chair touched mine; his hand, quietly advanced,
turned me towards him.</p>
<p id="id03615">"Do you know Marie Justine?" said he again.</p>
<p id="id03616">The name re-pronounced by his lips overcame me
unaccountably. It did not prostrate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;no, it
stirred me up, running with haste and heat through my
veins&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;recalling an hour of quick pain, many days
and nights of heart-sickness. Near me as he now sat, strongly and
closely as he had long twined his life in
mine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;far as had progressed, and near as was
achieved our minds' and affections'
assimilation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the very suggestion of
interference, of heart-separation, could be heard only with a
fermenting excitement, an impetuous throe, a disdainful resolve, an
ire, a resistance of which no human eye or cheek could hide the
flame, nor any truth-accustomed human tongue curb the cry.</p>
<p id="id03617">"I want to tell you something," I said: "I want to
tell you all."</p>
<p id="id03618">"Speak, Lucy; come near; speak. Who prizes you, if
I do not? Who is your friend, if not Emanuel? Speak!"</p>
<p id="id03619">I spoke. All escaped from my lips. I lacked not
words now; fast I narrated; fluent I told my tale; it streamed on
my tongue. I went back to the night in the park; I mentioned the
medicated draught&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;why it was
given&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;its goading effect&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how
it had torn rest from under my head, shaken me from my couch,
carried me abroad with the lure of a vivid yet solemn
fancy&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a summer-night solitude on turf, under
trees, near a deep, cool lakelet. I told the scene realized; the
crowd, the masques, the music, the lamps, the splendours, the guns
booming afar, the bells sounding on high. All I had encountered I
detailed, all I had recognised, heard, and seen; how I had beheld
and watched himself: how I listened, how much heard, what
conjectured; the whole history, in brief, summoned to his
confidence, rushed thither, truthful, literal, ardent, bitter.</p>
<p id="id03620">Still as I narrated, instead of checking, he
incited me to proceed he spurred me by the gesture, the smile, the
half-word. Before I had half done, he held both my hands, he
consulted my eyes with a most piercing glance: there was something
in his face which tended neither to calm nor to put me down; he
forgot his own doctrine, he forsook his own system of repression
when I most challenged its exercise. I think I deserved strong
reproof; but when have we our deserts? I merited severity; he
looked indulgence. To my very self I seemed imperious and
unreasonable, for I forbade Justine Marie my door and roof; he
smiled, betraying delight. Warm, jealous, and haughty, I knew not
till now that my nature had such a mood: he gathered me near his
heart. I was full of faults; he took them and me all home. For the
moment of utmost mutiny, he reserved the one deep spell of peace.
These words caressed my ear:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03621">"Lucy, take my love. One day share my life. Be my
dearest, first on earth."</p>
<p id="id03622">We walked back to the Rue Fossette by
moonlight&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;such moonlight as fell on
Eden&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;shining through the shades of the Great
Garden, and haply gilding a path glorious for a step
divine&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a Presence nameless. Once in their lives
some men and women go back to these first fresh days of our great
Sire and Mother&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;taste that grand morning's
dew&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bathe in its sunrise.</p>
<p id="id03623">In the course of the walk I was told how Justine
Marie Sauveur had always been regarded with the affection proper to
a daughter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how, with M. Paul's consent, she had
been affianced for months to one Heinrich M&Atilde;&frac14;hler, a
wealthy young German merchant, and was to be married in the course
of a year. Some of M. Emanuel's relations and connections would,
indeed, it seems, have liked him to marry her, with a view to
securing her fortune in the family; but to himself the scheme was
repugnant, and the idea totally inadmissible.</p>
<p id="id03624">We reached Madame Beck's door. Jean Baptiste's
clock tolled nine. At this hour, in this house, eighteen months
since, had this man at my side bent before me, looked into my face
and eyes, and arbitered my destiny. This very evening he had again
stooped, gazed, and decreed. How different the
look&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;how far otherwise the fate!</p>
<p id="id03625">He deemed me born under his star: he seemed to have
spread over me its beam like a banner.
Once&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;unknown, and unloved, I held him harsh and
strange; the low stature, the wiry make, the angles, the darkness,
the manner, displeased me. Now, penetrated with his influence, and
living by his affection, having his worth by intellect, and his
goodness by heart&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I preferred him before all
humanity.</p>
<p id="id03626">We parted: he gave me his pledge, and then his
farewell. We parted: the next day&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he sailed.</p>
<h2 id="id03627" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<h5 id="id03628">FINIS.</h5>
<p id="id03629" style="margin-top: 2em">Man cannot prophesy. Love
is no oracle. Fear sometimes imagines a vain thing. Those years of
absence! How had I sickened over their anticipation! The woe they
must bring seemed certain as death. I knew the nature of their
course: I never had doubt how it would harrow as it went. The
juggernaut on his car towered there a grim load. Seeing him draw
nigh, burying his broad wheels in the oppressed
soil&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I, the prostrate
votary&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;felt beforehand the annihilating
craunch.</p>
<p id="id03630">Strange to say&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;strange, yet
true, and owning many parallels in life's
experience&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that anticipatory craunch proved
all&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;yes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;nearly <i>all</i> the
torture. The great Juggernaut, in his great chariot, drew on lofty,
loud, and sullen. He passed quietly, like a shadow sweeping the
sky, at noon. Nothing but a chilling dimness was seen or felt. I
looked up. Chariot and demon charioteer were gone by; the votary
still lived.</p>
<p id="id03631">M. Emanuel was away three years. Reader, they were
the three happiest years of my life. Do you scout the paradox?
Listen. I commenced my school; I worked&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I worked
hard. I deemed myself the steward of his property, and determined,
God willing, to render a good account. Pupils
came&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;burghers at first&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
higher class ere long. About the middle of the second year an
unexpected chance threw into my hands an additional hundred pounds:
one day I received from England a letter containing that sum. It
came from Mr. Marchmont, the cousin and heir of my dear and dead
mistress. He was just recovering from a dangerous illness; the
money was a peace-offering to his conscience, reproaching him in
the matter of, I know not what, papers or memoranda found after his
kinswoman's death&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;naming or recommending Lucy
Snowe. Mrs. Barrett had given him my address. How far his
conscience had been sinned against, I never inquired. I asked no
questions, but took the cash and made it useful.</p>
<p id="id03632">With this hundred pounds I ventured to take the
house adjoining mine. I would not leave that which M. Paul had
chosen, in which he had left, and where he expected again to find
me. My externat became a pensionnat; that also prospered.</p>
<p id="id03633">The secret of my success did not lie so much in
myself, in any endowment, any power of mine, as in a new state of
circumstances, a wonderfully changed life, a relieved heart. The
spring which moved my energies lay far away beyond seas, in an
Indian isle. At parting, I had been left a legacy; such a thought
for the present, such a hope for the future, such a motive for a
persevering, a laborious, an enterprising, a patient and a brave
course&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I <i>could</i> not flag. Few things shook
me now; few things had importance to vex, intimidate, or depress
me: most things pleased&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;mere trifles had a
charm.</p>
<p id="id03634">Do not think that this genial flame sustained
itself, or lived wholly on a bequeathed hope or a parting promise.
A generous provider supplied bounteous fuel. I was spared all
chill, all stint; I was not suffered to fear penury; I was not
tried with suspense. By every vessel he wrote; he wrote as he gave
and as he loved, in full-handed, full-hearted plenitude. He wrote
because he liked to write; he did not abridge, because he cared not
to abridge. He sat down, he took pen and paper, because he loved
Lucy and had much to say to her; because he was faithful and
thoughtful, because he was tender and true. There was no sham and
no cheat, and no hollow unreal in him. Apology never dropped her
slippery oil on his lips&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;never proffered, by his
pen, her coward feints and paltry nullities: he would give neither
a stone, nor an excuse&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;neither a scorpion; nor a
disappointment; his letters were real food that nourished, living
water that refreshed.</p>
<p id="id03635">And was I grateful? God knows! I believe that
scarce a living being so remembered, so sustained, dealt with in
kind so constant, honourable and noble, could be otherwise than
grateful to the death.</p>
<p id="id03636">Adherent to his own religion (in him was not the
stuff of which is made the facile apostate), he freely left me my
pure faith. He did not tease nor tempt. He
said:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;</p>
<p id="id03637">"Remain a Protestant. My little English Puritan, I
love Protestantism in you. I own its severe charm. There is
something in its ritual I cannot receive myself, but it is the sole
creed for 'Lucy.'"</p>
<p id="id03638">All Rome could not put into him bigotry, nor the
Propaganda itself make him a real Jesuit. He was born honest, and
not false&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;artless, and not
cunning&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a freeman, and not a slave. His
tenderness had rendered him ductile in a priest's hands, his
affection, his devotedness, his sincere pious enthusiasm blinded
his kind eyes sometimes, made him abandon justice to himself to do
the work of craft, and serve the ends of selfishness; but these are
faults so rare to find, so costly to their owner to indulge, we
scarce know whether they will not one day be reckoned amongst the
jewels.</p>
<p id="id03639">* * * * *</p>
<p id="id03640">And now the three years are past: M. Emanuel's
return is fixed. It is Autumn; he is to be with me ere the mists of
November come. My school flourishes, my house is ready: I have made
him a little library, filled its shelves with the books he left in
my care: I have cultivated out of love for him (I was naturally no
florist) the plants he preferred, and some of them are yet in
bloom. I thought I loved him when he went away; I love him now in
another degree: he is more my own.</p>
<p id="id03641">The sun passes the equinox; the days shorten, the
leaves grow sere; but&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;-he is coming.</p>
<p id="id03642">Frosts appear at night; November has sent his fogs
in advance; the wind takes its autumn moan;
but&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;he is coming.</p>
<p id="id03643">The skies hang full and dark&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a
wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast themselves into strange
forms&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;arches and broad radiations; there rise
resplendent mornings&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;glorious, royal, purple as
monarch in his state; the heavens are one flame; so wild are they,
they rival battle at its thickest&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;so bloody,
they shame Victory in her pride. I know some signs of the sky; I
have noted them ever since childhood. God watch that sail! Oh!
guard it!</p>
<p id="id03644">The wind shifts to the west. Peace, peace,
Banshee&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;"keening" at every window! It will
rise&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it will swell&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it shrieks
out long: wander as I may through the house this night, I cannot
lull the blast. The advancing hours make it strong: by midnight,
all sleepless watchers hear and fear a wild south-west storm. That
storm roared frenzied, for seven days. It did not cease till the
Atlantic was strewn with wrecks: it did not lull till the deeps had
gorged their full of sustenance. Not till the destroying angel of
tempest had achieved his perfect work, would he fold the wings
whose waft was thunder&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the tremor of whose
plumes was storm.</p>
<p id="id03645">Peace, be still! Oh! a thousand weepers, praying in
agony on waiting shores, listened for that voice, but it was not
uttered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not uttered till; when the hush came,
some could not feel it: till, when the sun returned, his light was
night to some!</p>
<p id="id03646">Here pause: pause at once. There is enough said.
Trouble no quiet, kind heart; leave sunny imaginations hope. Let it
be theirs to conceive the delight of joy born again fresh out of
great terror, the rapture of rescue from peril, the wondrous
reprieve from dread, the fruition of return. Let them picture union
and a happy succeeding life.</p>
<p id="id03647">Madame Beck prospered all the days of her life; so
did P&Atilde;&uml;re Silas;<br />
Madame Walravens fulfilled her ninetieth year before she died.
Farewell.<br /></p>

United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying,
distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works
by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the
terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name
associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of

expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on,

Project Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be
stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a
copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective
or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer

<h4 id="id03685" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 2. Information
about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>
<p id="id03686">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free
distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest
variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p id="id03687">Volunteers and financial support to provide
volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching
Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent
future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn
more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</p>

<h4 id="id03692" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4. Information
about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h4>
<p id="id03693">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot
survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry
out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and
licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable
form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated
equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly
important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>
<p id="id03694">The Foundation is committed to complying with the
laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states
of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and
it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
donations in locations where we have not received written
confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://pglaf.org</p>
<p id="id03695">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions
from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we
know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from
donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p id="id03696">International donations are gratefully accepted,
but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of
donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone
swamp our small staff.</p>
<p id="id03697">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for
current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a
number of other ways including including checks, online payments
and credit card donations. To donate, please visit:

Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h4>
<p id="id03699">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the
Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that
could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced
and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose
network of volunteer support.</p>
<p id="id03700" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks
are often created from several printed editions, all of which are
confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is
included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Notes</h3>
<p>In the List of Illustrations I restored a missing single quote
after <i>Lenore!</i> as shown below:</p>
<p class="indent">"'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent
thee&mdash;by these angels he hath sent thee<br />
Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from thy memories of
Lenore!'"</p>
<p>The List of Illustrations uses 'visitor' where the poem and the
actual illustration use 'visiter'.</p>

<h2><a name="COMMENT_ON_THE_POEM" id=
"COMMENT_ON_THE_POEM"></a>COMMENT ON THE POEM.</h2>
<p>The secret of a poem, no less than a jest's prosperity, lies in
the ear of him that hears it. Yield to its spell, accept the poet's
mood: this, after all, is what the sages answer when you ask them
of its value. Even though the poet himself, in his other mood, tell
you that his art is but sleight of hand, his food enchanter's food,
and offer to show you the trick of it,&mdash;believe him not. Wait
for his prophetic hour; then give yourself to his passion, his joy
or pain. "We are in Love's hand to-day!" sings Gautier, in
Swinburne's buoyant paraphrase,&mdash;and from morn to sunset we
are wafted on the violent sea: there is but one love, one May, one
flowery strand. Love is eternal, all else unreal and put aside. The
vision has an end, the scene changes; but we have gained something,
the memory of a charm. As many poets, so many charms. There is the
charm of Evanescence, that which lends to supreme beauty and grace
an aureole of Pathos. Share with Landor his one "night of memories
and of sighs" for Rose Aylmer, and you have this to the full.</p>
<p>And now take the hand of a new-world minstrel, strayed from some
proper habitat to that rude and dissonant America which, as
Baudelaire saw, "was for Poe only a vast prison through which he
ran, hither and thither, with the feverish agitation of a being
created to breathe in a purer world," and where "his interior life,
spiritual as a poet, spiritual even as a drunkard, was but one
perpetual effort to escape the influence of this antipathetical
atmosphere." Clasp the sensitive hand of a troubled singer dreeing
thus his weird, and share with him the clime in which he
found,&mdash;never throughout the day, always in the
night,&mdash;if not the Atlantis whence he had wandered, at least a
place of refuge from the bounds in which by day he was immured.</p>
<p>To one land only he has power to lead you, and for one night
only can you share his dream. A tract of neither Earth nor Heaven:
"No-man's-land," out of Space, out of Time. Here are the perturbed
ones, through whose eyes, like those of the Cenci, the soul finds
windows though the mind is dazed; here spirits, groping for the
path which leads to Eternity, are halted and delayed. It is the
limbo of "planetary souls," wherein are all moonlight
uncertainties, all lost loves and illusions. Here some are fixed in
trance, the only respite attainable; others</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">"move
fantastically<br /></span> <span class="i0">To a discordant
melody:"<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>while everywhere are</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Sheeted Memories of the
Past&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Shrouded forms that start
and sigh<br /></span> <span class="i0">As they pass the wanderer
by."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Such is the land, and for one night we enter it,&mdash;a night
of astral phases and recurrent chimes. Its monodies are twelve
poems, whose music strives to change yet ever is the same. One by
one they sound, like the chiming of the brazen and ebony clock, in
"The Masque of the Red Death," which made the waltzers pause with
"disconcert and tremulousness and meditation," as often as the hour
came round.</p>
<p>Of all these mystical cadences, the plaint of <i>The Raven</i>,
vibrating through the portal, chiefly has impressed the outer
world. What things go to the making of a poem,&mdash;and how true
in this, as in most else, that race which named its bards "the
makers"? A work is called out of the void. Where there was nothing,
it remains,&mdash;a new creation, part of the treasure of mankind.
And a few exceptional lyrics, more than others that are equally
creative, compel us to think anew how bravely the poet's pen turns
things unknown</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i2">"to shapes, and gives to airy
nothing<br /></span> <span class="i0">A local habitation, and a
name."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Each seems without a prototype, yet all fascinate us with
elements wrested from the shadow of the Supernatural. Now the
highest imagination is concerned about the soul of things; it may
or may not inspire the Fantasy that peoples with images the
interlunar vague. Still, one of these lyrics, in its smaller way,
affects us with a sense of uniqueness, as surely as the sublimer
works of a supernatural cast,&mdash;Marlowe's "Faustus," the
"Faust" of Goethe, "Manfred," or even those ethereal masterpieces,
"The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream." More than one, while
otherwise unique, has some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> burden or refrain which haunts the
memory,&mdash;once heard, never forgotten, like the tone of a
rarely used but distinctive organ-stop. Notable among them is
B&uuml;rger's "Lenore," that ghostly and resonant ballad, the lure
and foil of the translators. Few will deny that Coleridge's
wondrous "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" stands at their very head.
"Le Juif-Errant" would have claims, had Beranger been a greater
poet; and, but for their remoteness from popular sympathy, "The
Lady of Shalott" and "The Blessed Damozel" might be added to the
list. It was given to Edgar Allan Poe to produce two lyrics, "The
Bells" and <i>The Raven</i>, each of which, although perhaps of
less beauty than those of Tennyson and Rossetti, is a unique.
"Ulalume," while equally strange and imaginative, has not the
universal quality that is a portion of our test.</p>
<p><i>The Raven</i> in sheer poetical constituents falls below such
pieces as "The Haunted Palace," "The City in the Sea," "The
Sleeper," and "Israfel." The whole of it would be exchanged, I
suspect, by readers of a fastidious cast, for such passages as
these:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Around, by lifting winds
forgot,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Resignedly beneath the
sky<br /></span> <span class="i0">The melancholy waters
lie.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">No rays from the holy heaven
come down<br /></span> <span class="i0">On the long night-time of
that town;<br /></span> <span class="i0">But light from out the
lurid sea<br /></span> <span class="i0">Streams up the turrets
silently&mdash;<br /></span> <span class=
"i2"><b>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br />
</span> <span class="i0">Up many and many a marvellous
shrine<br /></span> <span class="i0">Whose wreath&eacute;d friezes
intertwine<br /></span> <span class="i0">The viol, the violet, and
the vine.<br /></span> <span class=
"i2"><b>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br />
</span> <span class="i0">No swellings tell that winds may
be<br /></span> <span class="i0">Upon some far-off happier
sea&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">No heavings hint that
winds have been<br /></span> <span class="i0">On seas less
hideously serene."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>It lacks the aerial melody of the poet whose heart-strings are a
lute:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"And they say (the starry
choir<br /></span> <span class="i0">And the other listening
things)<br /></span> <span class="i0">That Israfeli's
fire<br /></span> <span class="i0">Is owing to that
lyre<br /></span> <span class="i0">By which he sits and
sings&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">The trembling living
wire<br /></span> <span class="i0">Of those unusual
strings."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>But <i>The Raven</i>, like "The Bells" and "Annabel Lee,"
commends itself to the many and the few. I have said elsewhere that
Poe's rarer productions seemed to me "those in which there is the
appearance, at least, of spontaneity,&mdash;in which he yields to
his feelings, while dying falls and cadences most musical, most
melancholy, come from him unawares." This is still my belief; and
yet, upon a fresh study of this poem, it impresses me more than at
any time since my boyhood. Close acquaintance tells in favor of
every true work of art. Induce the man, who neither knows art nor
cares for it, to examine some poem or painting, and how soon its
force takes hold of him! In fact, he will overrate the relative
value of the first good work by which his attention has been fairly
caught. <i>The Raven</i>, also, has consistent qualities which even
an expert must admire. In no other of its author's poems is the
motive more palpably defined. "The Haunted Palace" is just as
definite to the select reader, but Poe scarcely would have taken
that subtle allegory for bald analysis. <i>The Raven</i> is wholly
occupied with the author's typical theme&mdash;the irretrievable
loss of an idolized and beautiful woman; but on other grounds,
also, the public instinct is correct in thinking it his
representative poem.</p>
<p>A man of genius usually gains a footing with the success of some
one effort, and this is not always his greatest. Recognition is the
more instant for having been postponed. He does not acquire it,
like a miser's fortune, coin after coin, but "not at all or all in
all." And thus with other ambitions: the courtier, soldier,
actor,&mdash;whatever their parts,&mdash;each counts his triumph
from some lucky stroke. Poe's Raven, despite augury, was for him
"the bird that made the breeze to blow." The poet settled in
New-York, in the winter of 1844-'45, finding work upon Willis's
paper, "The Evening Mirror," and eking out his income by
contributions elsewhere. For six years he had been an active
writer, and enjoyed a professional reputation; was held in both
respect and misdoubt, and was at no loss for his share of the
ill-paid journalism of that day. He also had done much of his very
best work,&mdash;such tales as "Ligeia" and "The Fall of the House
of Usher," (the latter containing that mystical counterpart, in
verse, of Elihu Vedder's "A Lost Mind,") such analytic feats as
"The Gold Bug" and "The Mystery of Marie Roget." He had made
proselytes abroad, and gained a lasting hold upon the French mind.
He had learned his own power and weakness, and was at his prime,
and not without a certain reputation. But he had written nothing
that was on the tongue of everybody. To rare and delicate work some
popular touch must be added to capture the general audience of
one's own time.</p>
<p>Through the industry of Poe's successive biographers, the hit
made by <i>The Raven</i> has become an oft-told tale. The poet's
young wife, Virginia, was fading before his eyes, but lingered for
another year within death's shadow. The long, low chamber in the
house near the Bloomingdale Road is as<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> famous as
the room where Rouget de l'Isle composed the Marseillaise. All have
heard that the poem, signed "Quarles," appeared in the "American
Review," with a pseudo-editorial comment on its form; that Poe
received ten dollars for it; that Willis, the kindest and least
envious of fashionable arbiters, reprinted it with a eulogy that
instantly made it town-talk. All doubt of its authorship was
dispelled when Poe recited it himself at a literary gathering, and
for a time he was the most marked of American authors. The hit
stimulated and encouraged him. Like another and prouder satirist,
he too found "something of summer" even "in the hum of insects."
Sorrowfully enough, but three years elapsed,&mdash;a period of
influence, pride, anguish, yet always of imaginative or critical
labor,&mdash;before the final defeat, before the curtain dropped on
a life that for him was in truth a tragedy, and he yielded to "the
Conqueror Worm."</p>
<p>"The American Review: A Whig Journal" was a creditable magazine
for the time, double-columned, printed on good paper with clear
type, and illustrated by mezzotint portraits. Amid much matter
below the present standard, it contained some that any editor would
be glad to receive. The initial volume, for 1845, has articles by
Horace Greeley, Donald Mitchell, Walter Whitman, Marsh, Tuckerman,
and Whipple. Ralph Hoyt's quaint poem, "Old," appeared in this
volume. And here are three lyrics by Poe: "The City in the Sea,"
"The Valley of Unrest," and <i>The Raven</i>. Two of these were
built up,&mdash;such was his way,&mdash;from earlier studies, but
the last-named came out as if freshly composed, and almost as we
have it now. The statement that it was not afterward revised is
erroneous. Eleven trifling changes from the magazine-text appear in
<i>The Raven and Other Poems</i>, 1845, a book which the poet
shortly felt encouraged to offer the public. These are mostly
changes of punctuation, or of single words, the latter kind made to
heighten the effect of alliteration. In Mr. Lang's pretty edition
of Poe's verse, brought out in the "Parchment Library," he has
shown the instinct of a scholar, and has done wisely, in going back
to the text in the volume just mentioned, as given in the London
issue of 1846. The "standard" Griswold collection of the poet's
works abounds with errors. These have been repeated by later
editors, who also have made errors of their own. But the text of
<i>The Raven</i>, owing to the requests made to the author for
manuscript copies, was still farther revised by him; in fact, he
printed it in Richmond, just before his death, with the poetic
substitution of "seraphim whose foot-falls" for "angels whose faint
foot-falls," in the fourteenth stanza. Our present text, therefore,
while substantially that of 1845, is somewhat modified by the
poet's later reading, and is, I think, the most correct and
effective version of this single poem. The most radical change from
the earliest version appeared, however, in the volume in 1845; the
eleventh stanza originally having contained these lines, faulty in
rhyme and otherwise a blemish on the poem:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Caught from some unhappy
master, whom unmerciful Disaster<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Followed fast and followed faster&mdash;so, when Hope he would
adjure,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Stern Despair returned,
instead of the sweet Hope he dared adjure&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i20">That sad answer, 'Nevermore!'"<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>It would be well if other, and famous, poets could be as sure of
making their changes always improvements. Poe constantly rehandled
his scanty show of verse, and usually bettered it. <i>The Raven</i>
was the first of the few poems which he nearly brought to
completion before printing. It may be that those who care for
poetry lost little by his death. Fluent in prose, he never wrote
verse for the sake of making a poem. When a refrain of image
haunted him, the lyric that resulted was the inspiration, as he
himself said, of a passion, not of a purpose. This was at intervals
so rare as almost to justify the Fairfield theory that each was the
product of a nervous crisis.</p>
<p>What, then, gave the poet his clue to <i>The Raven</i>? From
what misty foundation did it rise slowly to a music slowly
breathed? As usual, more than one thing went to the building of so
notable a poem. Considering the longer sermons often preached on
brief and less suggestive texts, I hope not to be blamed for this
discussion of a single lyric,&mdash;especially one which an artist
like Dor&eacute; has made the subject of prodigal illustration.
Until recently I had supposed that this piece, and a few which its
author composed after its appearance, were exceptional in not
having grown from germs in his boyish verse. But Mr. Fearing Gill
has shown me some unpublished stanzas by Poe, written in his
eighteenth year, and entitled, "The Demon of the Fire." The
manuscript appears to be in the poet's early handwriting, and its
genuineness is vouched for by the family in whose possession it has
remained for half a century. Besides the plainest germs of "The
Bells" and "The Haunted Palace" it contains a few lines somewhat
suggestive of the opening and close of <i>The Raven</i>. As to the
rhythm of our poem, a comparison of dates indicates that this was
influenced by the rhythm of "Lady Geraldine's Courtship." Poe was
one of the first to honor Miss Barrett's genius; he inscribed his
collected poems to her as "the noblest of her sex," and was
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id=
"Page_12">[12]</a></span> sympathy with her lyrical method. The
lines from her love-poem,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"With a murmurous stir
uncertain, in the air, the purple curtain<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale
brows,"<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>found an echo in these:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"And the silken sad uncertain
rustling of each purple curtain<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt
before."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Here Poe assumed a privilege for which he roughly censured
Longfellow, and which no one ever sought on his own premises
without swift detection and chastisement. In melody and stanzaic
form, we shall see that the two poems are not unlike, but in motive
they are totally distinct. The generous poetess felt nothing but
the true originality of the poet. "This vivid writing!" she
exclaimed,&mdash;"this power which is felt!... Our great poet, Mr.
Browning, author of 'Paracelsus,' &amp;c., is enthusiastic in his
admiration of the rhythm." Mr. Ingram, after referring to "Lady
Geraldine," cleverly points out another source from which Poe may
have caught an impulse. In 1843, Albert Pike, the half-Greek,
half-frontiersman, poet of Arkansas, had printed in "The New
Mirror," for which Poe then was writing, some verses entitled
"Isadore," but since revised by the author and called "The Widowed
Heart." I select from Mr. Pike's revision the following stanza, of
which the main features correspond with the original version:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Restless I pace our lonely
rooms, I play our songs no more,<br /></span> <span class="i0">The
garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mocking-bird still sits and sings, O
melancholy strain!<br /></span> <span class="i0">For my heart is
like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Thou art lost to me forever,
Isadore!"<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Here we have a prolonged measure, a similarity of refrain, and
the introduction of a bird whose song enhances sorrow. There are
other trails which may be followed by the curious; notably, a
passage which Mr. Ingram selects from Poe's final review of
"Barnaby Rudge":</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The raven, too, * * * might have been made, more than we now
see it, a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby. * * *
Its character might have performed, in regard to that of the idiot,
much the same part as does, in music, the accompaniment in respect
to the air."</p>
</div>
<p>Nevertheless, after pointing out these germs and resemblances,
the value of this poem still is found in its originality. The
progressive music, the scenic detail and contrasted light and
shade,&mdash;above all, the spiritual passion of the nocturn, make
it the work of an informing genius. As for the gruesome bird, he is
unlike all the other ravens of his clan, from the "twa corbies" and
"three ravens" of the balladists to Barnaby's rumpled "Grip." Here
is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets
and treads the field of heraldry; no boding phantom of which
Tickell sang that, when,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"shrieking at her window
thrice,<br /></span> <span class="i0">The raven flap'd his
wing,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Too well the love-lorn maiden
knew<br /></span> <span class="i0">The solemn boding
sound."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Poe's raven is a distinct conception; the incarnation of a
mourner's agony and hopelessness; a sable embodied Memory, the
abiding chronicler of doom, a type of the Irreparable. Escaped
across the Styx, from "the Night's Plutonian shore," he seems the
imaged soul of the questioner himself,&mdash;of him who can not,
will not, quaff the kind nepenthe, because the memory of Lenore is
all that is left him, and with the surcease of his sorrow even that
would be put aside.</p>
<p><i>The Raven</i> also may be taken as a representative poem of
its author, for its exemplification of all his notions of what a
poem should be. These are found in his essays on "The Poetic
Principle," "The Rationale of Verse," and "The Philosophy of
Composition." Poe declared that "in Music, perhaps, the soul most
nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the Poetic
Sentiment, it struggles&mdash;the creation of supernal Beauty....
Verse cannot be better designated than as an inferior or less
capable music"; but again, verse which is really the "Poetry of
Words" is "The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty,"&mdash;this and
nothing more. The <i>tone</i> of the highest Beauty is one of
Sadness. The most melancholy of topics is Death. This must be
allied to Beauty. "The death, then, of a beautiful woman is,
unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world,&mdash;and
equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a
topic are those of a bereaved lover." These last expressions are
quoted from Poe's whimsical analysis of this very poem, but they
indicate precisely the general range of his verse. The climax of
"The Bells" is the muffled monotone of ghouls, who glory in
weighing down the human heart. "Lenore," <i>The Raven</i>, "The
Sleeper," "To One in Paradise," and "Ulalume" form a tenebrose
symphony,&mdash;and "Annabel Lee," written last of all, shows that
one theme possessed him to the end. Again, these are all nothing if
not musical, and some are touched with that quality of the
Fantastic which awakes the sense of awe, and adds a new fear to
agony itself. Through all is dimly outlined, beneath a shadowy
pall, the poet's ideal love,&mdash;so often half-portrayed
elsewhere,&mdash;the entombed wife of Usher, the Lady Ligeia,
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id=
"Page_13">[13]</a></span> truth the counterpart of his own nature.
I suppose that an artist's love for one "in the form" never can
wholly rival his devotion to some ideal. The woman near him must
exercise her spells, be all by turns and nothing long, charm him
with infinite variety, or be content to forego a share of his
allegiance. He must be lured by the Unattainable, and this is ever
just beyond him in his passion for creative art.</p>
<p>Poe, like Hawthorne, came in with the decline of the Romantic
school, and none delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity.
Yet his heart was with the romancers and their Oriental or Gothic
effects. His invention, so rich in the prose tales, seemed to
desert him when he wrote verse; and his judgment told him that long
romantic poems depend more upon incident than
inspiration,&mdash;and that, to utter the poetry of romance, lyrics
would suffice. Hence his theory, clearly fitted to his own
limitations, that "a 'long poem' is a flat contradiction in terms."
The components of <i>The Raven</i> are few and simple: a man, a
bird, and the phantasmal memory at a woman. But the piece affords a
fine display of romantic material. What have we? The midnight; the
shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; the
student,&mdash;a modern Hieronymus; the raven's tap on the
casement; the wintry night and dying fire; the silken wind-swept
hangings; the dreams and vague mistrust of the echoing darkness;
the black, uncanny bird upon the pallid bust; the accessories of
violet velvet and the gloating lamp. All this stage effect of
situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, and even
melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely
exhibits, and thoroughly reflective of the poet's "eternal passion,
eternal pain."</p>
<p>The rhythmical structure of <i>The Raven</i> was sure to make an
impression. Rhyme, alliteration, the burden, the stanzaic form,
were devised with singular adroitness. Doubtless the poet was
struck with the aptness of Miss Barrett's musical trochaics, in
"eights," and especially by the arrangement adopted near the close
of "Lady Geraldine":</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"'Eyes,' he said, 'now
throbbing through me! Are ye eyes that did undo me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining eyes, like antique jewels set in Parian
statue-stone!<br /></span> <span class="i0">Underneath that calm
white forehead, are ye ever burning torrid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life
undone?'"<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>His artistic introduction of a third rhyme in both the second
and fourth lines, and the addition of a fifth line and a final
refrain, made the stanza of <i>The Raven</i>. The persistent
alliteration seems to come without effort, and often the rhymes
within lines are seductive; while the refrain or burden dominates
the whole work. Here also he had profited by Miss Barrett's study
of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues. A "refrain"
is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wandering
ear,&mdash;the recurrent longing of Nature for the initial strain.
I have always admired the beautiful refrains of the English
songstress,&mdash;"The Nightingales, the Nightingales," "Margret,
Margret," "My Heart and I," "Toll slowly," "The River floweth on,"
"Pan, Pan is dead," etc. She also employed what I term the
Repetend, in the use of which Poe has excelled all poets since
Coleridge thus revived it:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"O happy living things! no
tongue<br /></span> <span class="i0">Their beauty might
declare:<br /></span> <span class="i0">A spring of love gushed from
my heart,<br /></span> <span class="i0">And I blessed them
unaware:<br /></span> <span class="i0">Sure my kind saint took pity
on me,<br /></span> <span class="i0">And I blessed them
unaware."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the
repetend. He relied upon it to the uttermost in a few later
poems,&mdash;"Lenore," "Annabel Lee," "Ulalume," and "For Annie."
It gained a wild and melancholy music, I have thought, from the
"sweet influences," of the Afric burdens and repetends that were
sung to him in childhood, attuning with their native melody the
voice of our Southern poet.</p>
<p>"The Philosophy of Composition," his analysis of <i>The
Raven</i>, is a technical dissection of its method and structure.
Neither his avowal of cold-blooded artifice, nor his subsequent
avowal to friends that an exposure of this artifice was only
another of his intellectual hoaxes, need be wholly credited. If he
had designed the complete work in advance, he scarcely would have
made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to the delicious
melody of the second stanza,&mdash;not even upon his theory of the
fantastic. Of course an artist, having perfected a work, sees, like
the first Artist, that it is good, and sees why it is good. A
subsequent analysis, coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire,
readily enough may be made. My belief is that the first conception
and rough draft of this poem came as inspiration always comes; that
its author then saw how it might be perfected, giving it the final
touches described in his chapter on Composition, and that the
latter, therefore, is neither wholly false nor wholly true. The
harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancy that
artificial processes can supersede imagination. The impulse of
genius is to guard the secrets of its creative hour. Glimpses
obtained of the toil, the baffled experiments, which precede a
triumph, as in the sketch-work of Hawthorne recently brought to
light, afford priceless instruction and encouragement to the
sincere artist. But one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">[14]</a></span> who voluntarily exposes his Muse to the
gaze of all comers should recall the fate of King Candaules.</p>
<p>The world still thinks of Poe as a "luckless man of genius." I
recently heard him mentioned as "one whom everybody seems chartered
to misrepresent, decry or slander." But it seems to me that his
ill-luck ended with his pitiable death, and that since then his
defence has been persistent, and his fame of as steadfast growth as
a suffering and gifted author could pray for in his hopeful hour.
Griswold's decrial and slander turned the current in his favor.
Critics and biographers have come forward with successive
refutations, with tributes to his character, with new editions of
his works. His own letters and the minute incidents of his career
are before us; the record, good and bad, is widely known. No
appellor has received more tender and forgiving judgement. His
mishaps in life belonged to his region and period, perchance still
more to his own infirmity of will. Doubtless his environment was
not one to guard a fine-grained, ill-balanced nature from perils
without and within. His strongest will, to be lord of himself,
gained for him "that heritage of woe." He confessed himself the
bird's unhappy master, the stricken sufferer of this poem. But his
was a full share of that dramatic temper which exults in the
presage of its own doom. There is a delight in playing one's high
part: we are all gladiators, crying <i>Ave Imperator!</i> To quote
Burke's matter of fact: "In grief the pleasure is still uppermost,
and the affliction we suffer has no resemblance to absolute pain,
which is always odious, and which we endeavor to shake off as soon
as possible." Poe went farther, and was an artist even in the
tragedy of his career. If, according to his own belief, sadness and
the vanishing of beauty are the highest poetic themes, and poetic
feeling the keenest earthly pleasure, then the sorrow and darkness
of his broken life were not without their frequent
compensation.</p>
<p>In the following pages, we have a fresh example of an artist's
genius characterizing his interpretation of a famous poem. Gustave
Dor&eacute;, the last work of whose pencil is before us, was not
the painter, or even the draughtsman, for realists demanding truth
of tone, figure, and perfection. Such matters concerned him less
than to make shape and distance, light and shade, assist his
purpose,&mdash;which was to excite the soul, the imagination, of
the looker on. This he did by arousing our sense of awe, through
marvellous and often sublime conceptions of things unutterable and
full of gloom or glory. It is well said that if his works were not
great paintings, as pictures they are great indeed. As a "literary
artist," and such he was, his force was in direct ratio with the
dramatic invention of his author, with the brave audacities of the
spirit that kindled his own. Hence his success with Rabelais, with
"Le Juif-Errant," "Les Contes Drolatiques," and "Don Quixote," and
hence, conversely, his failure to express the beauty of Tennyson's
Idyls, of "Il Paradiso," of the Hebrew pastorals, and other texts
requiring exaltation, or sweetness and repose. He was a born master
of the grotesque, and by a special insight could portray the
spectres of a haunted brain. We see objects as his personages saw
them, and with the very eyes of the Wandering Jew, the bewildered
Don, or the goldsmith's daughter whose fancy so magnifies the King
in the shop on the Pont-au-Change. It was in the nature of things
that he should be attracted to each masterpiece of verse or prose
that I have termed unique. The lower kingdoms were called into his
service; his rocks, trees and mountains, the sky itself, are
animate with motive and diablerie. Had he lived to illustrate
Shakespeare, we should have seen a remarkable treatment of Caliban,
the Witches, the storm in "Lear"; but doubtless should have
questioned his ideals of Imogen or Miranda. Beauty pure and simple,
and the perfect excellence thereof, he rarely seemed to
comprehend.</p>
<p>Yet there is beauty in his designs for the "Ancient Mariner,"
unreal as they are, and a consecutiveness rare in a series by
Dor&eacute;. The Rime afforded him a prolonged story, with many
shiftings of the scene. In <i>The Raven</i> sound and color
preserve their monotone and we have no change of place or occasion.
What is the result? Dor&eacute; proffers a series of variations
upon the theme as he conceived it, "the enigma of death and the
hallucination of an inconsolable soul." In some of these drawings
his faults are evident; others reveal his powerful originality, and
the best qualities in which, as a draughtsman, he stood alone.
Plainly there was something in common between the working moods of
Poe and Dor&eacute;. This would appear more clearly had the latter
tried his hand upon the "Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque."
Both resorted often to the elf-land of fantasy and romance. In
melodramatic feats they both, through their command of the
supernatural, avoided the danger-line between the ideal and the
absurd. Poe was the truer worshipper of the Beautiful; his love for
it was a consecrating passion, and herein he parts company with his
illustrator. Poet or artist, Death at last transfigures all: within
the shadow of his sable harbinger, Vedder's symbolic crayon aptly
sets them face to face, but enfolds them with the mantle of
immortal wisdom and power. An American woman has wrought the image
of a star-eyed Genius with the final torch, the exquisite semblance
of one whose vision beholds, but whose lips may not utter, the
mysteries of a land beyond "the door of a legended tomb."</p>

window lattice;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Let me see, then,
what thereat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery
explore;&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i20">'T is the wind and
nothing more!"<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Open here I flung the shutter,
when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of
yore.<br /></span> <span class="i0">Not the least obeisance made
he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber
door&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Perched upon a bust of
Pallas just above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span> <span class=
"i20">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id=

beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it
wore,<br /></span> <span class="i0">"Though thy crest be shorn and
shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the
Nightly shore,&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Tell me what
thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Much I marvelled this ungainly
fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy
bore;<br /></span> <span class="i0">For we cannot help agreeing
that no living human being<br /></span> <span class="i0">Ever yet
was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber
door&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Bird or beast upon the
sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br /></span> <span class=
"i20">With such name as "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">But the Raven, sitting lonely
on the placid bust, spoke only<br /></span> <span class="i0">That
one word, as if his soul in that one word he did
outpour.<br /></span> <span class="i0">Nothing further then he
uttered&mdash;not a feather then he fluttered&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends
have flown before&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">On the
morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my hopes have flown
before."<br /></span> <span class="i20">Then the bird said,
"Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Startled at the stillness
broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and
store,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Caught from some unhappy
master whom unmerciful Disaster<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden
bore&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Till the dirges of his
Hope that melancholy burden bore<br /></span> <span class="i20">Of
'Never&mdash;nevermore.'"<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id=

beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust
and door;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Then, upon the velvet
sinking, I betook myself to linking<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of
yore&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">What this grim, ungainly,
ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br /></span> <span class=
"i20">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">This I sat engaged in
guessing, but no syllable expressing<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's
core;<br /></span> <span class="i0">This and more I sat divining,
with my head at ease reclining<br /></span> <span class="i0">On the
cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated
o'er,<br /></span> <span class="i0">But whose velvet violet lining
with the lamplight gloating o'er<br /></span> <span class=
"i20"><i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Then, methought, the air grew
denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br /></span> <span class=
"i0">Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted
floor.<br /></span> <span class="i0">"Wretch," I cried, "thy God
hath lent thee&mdash;by these angels he hath sent thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from thy
memories of Lenore!<br /></span> <span class="i0">Quaff, oh quaff
this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Prophet!" said I, "thing of
evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed
thee here ashore,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Desolate yet all
undaunted, on this desert land enchanted&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this home by Horror haunted&mdash;tell me
truly, I implore&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Is
there&mdash;<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?&mdash;tell
me&mdash;tell me, I implore!"<br /></span> <span class="i20">Quoth
the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id=

"thing of evil&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By that Heaven that bends above, us&mdash;by that
God we both adore&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Tell this
soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels
name Lenore&mdash;<br /></span> <span class="i0">Clasp a rare and
radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Be that word our sign of
parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's
Plutonian shore!<br /></span> <span class="i0">Leave no black plume
as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave my loneliness unbroken!&mdash;quit the bust
above my door!<br /></span> <span class="i0">Take thy beak from out
my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And the Raven, never flitting,
still is sitting, still is sitting<br /></span> <span class="i0">On
the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's
that is dreaming,<br /></span> <span class="i0">And the lamplight
o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my soul from out that shadow that lies
floating on the floor<br /></span> <span class="i20">Shall be
lifted&mdash;nevermore!<br /></span></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
